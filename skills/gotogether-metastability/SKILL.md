name: gotogether-metastability
description: Find and prevent metastable failures (retry storms, a queue that stays full after a spike) in Go services and controllers with gotogether's qload and qmeta packages - predict recovery with a CTMC (qmeta.New, HittingTimes, Field/SVG, Calibrate), confirm with a load simulation on virtual time (qload.Simulate, open- or closed-loop clients, the retry library under test as a qload.Retrier), search and shrink the smallest trigger with Hegel (qhegel.FindTrigger, Recovers), compare mitigations (backoff, retry budgets, rate limits), and turn the calibrated chain into alerting rules over the application's own load roles (qrole: //quint:serve, //quint:operation, //quint:call; qmeta.Trajectories, CalibrateTimeout, Region, Rules). Use when choosing or reviewing a retry, timeout, backoff, requeue or rate-limit policy, when a system degrades after a load spike or a dependency slowdown and does not come back, or when a controller's requeue behaviour under a cloud API incident is in question.

# Metastable failures with qload and qmeta

A metastable failure is not a wrong answer: it is a degraded state the
system cannot leave after its trigger is gone. A spike or a slowdown
fills a queue, and requests time out while the server still works on
them. Their retries keep the queue full. Correctness checks (Quint, qenv)
do not see it. These tools check the property that does:

> Within W after a transient stressor ends, goodput is back to at least
> 90% of what it was before.

Work in tiers, cheapest first, and let each check the next. This is the
pipeline of Alvaro et al. (2025) and Isaacs et al. (HotOS '25).

## 1. Predict: the CTMC (`qmeta`)

```go
p := qmeta.Params{Lambda: 9, Mu: 10, Workers: 1, Timeout: 9, Retries: 3, Queue: 100, Orbit: 120,
	Backoff: 0, RetryBudget: 0, RetryRate: 0} // mitigations, 0: none
c := qmeta.New(p)
h := c.HittingTimes(func(s qmeta.State) bool { return s.U <= 10 })
recovery := h[c.Index(qmeta.State{U: 100, V: 30})] // seconds, from a full queue
c.SVG(w, 10, 12)                                     // the field: where the dynamics go
```

- The state is (u, v): requests in the server, and requests in the orbit
  (their current attempt will time out, or they wait to retry).
- Recovery times that grow by orders of magnitude as λ rises mark the
  metastable region.
- Use the chain to rank policies and locate the tipping point. Do not use
  its absolute times: they can be off by orders of magnitude. For numbers,
  fit it to simulated trajectories with `qmeta.Calibrate`.
- Make the orbit bound (`Orbit`) generous. A chain truncated near the
  storm's size predicts recovery that isn't there.
- Mitigations: `Backoff` is the mean extra wait. `RetryBudget` caps
  retries per request, and `RetryRate` caps retries per second. Rejections
  at a full queue matter: an immediate retry burns its retries and gives
  up, while a retry after backoff comes back. The chain models both.

## 2. Confirm: the simulation (`qload`)

```go
cfg := qload.SimConfig{
	Server: qload.ServerConfig{Name: "api", Workers: 4, ServiceRate: 5, QueueCap: 100},
	Client: qload.ClientConfig{Name: "c", Rate: qload.Constant(9), Timeout: 9 * time.Second, Retries: 3,
		Retrier: func(rnd *rand.Rand) qload.Retrier { return myPolicy(rnd) }}, // the library under test
}
r := qload.Recovers(cfg, 9, qload.Trigger{ExtraRate: 5, Duration: time.Minute}, 5*time.Minute)
```

- Put the real retry library behind `qload.Retrier`, on virtual time.
- Controllers are closed loops: set `Population` and `Think`, or the
  simulation finds storms that cannot happen.
- Results are probabilities: count recoveries over seeds
  (`qload.Mostly`), and set a healthy baseline.
- The chain assumes exponential service: measure the handler
  (`qmeta.Measure`) and simulate with measured times when it is not.

Read [references/simulation.md](references/simulation.md) when writing
the simulation: the Retrier contract, closed loops, triggers, measured
service times, production workloads from a SimKube trace.

## 2b. Or run the application itself (`qload.Experiment`)

To put the real system under load, give its dependency a capacity, keep
everything else real, and count a model step's rate as goodput
(`qload.Assess`, `qload.Of`). Set `Healthy`; look for loops around the
retry loop (a broker's redelivery, a controller's requeue). Read
[references/experiment.md](references/experiment.md) when deploying an
application into an Experiment.

## 3. Search: Hegel (`qhegel.FindTrigger`)

```go
sys := qload.OfSimulation(cfg, base, 5*time.Minute) // or qload.Of(experiment, goodput, within)
r := qhegel.FindTrigger(t, sys, qload.TriggerSpace{MaxExtraRate: 10, MaxSlowdown: 4,
	MaxDuration: 5 * time.Minute, Start: 10 * time.Minute}, hegel.WithTestCases(30)).Expect(t, qload.SomeTrigger())
// r.Trigger is shrunk toward none
```

`Expect(t, qload.SomeTrigger())` for a design that should be shown fragile,
`Expect(t, qload.NoTrigger())` for the mitigation (no trigger in the space breaks it). If it returns the empty trigger, the system
collapses on noise alone: look for a design bound, such as more
concurrency than capacity × timeout. Each case runs `Seeds` (default 3)
simulations, so keep it out of `-short`.

## 4. Alert: the chain's region over the app's own load roles (`qrole`)

Mark the roles once (`//quint:serve`, `//quint:operation`,
`//quint:call`), calibrate the chain on their gauges with λ held
(`qmeta.CalibrateTimeout`), and turn the region of states unlikely to
recover within a bound (`Region`, by `RecoveryWithin`, not the mean
hitting time) into a Prometheus rule group (`Rules`) committed with the
code. Read [references/alerts.md](references/alerts.md) when marking
roles, calibrating, or writing the rules and the flight recorder
(`qmeta.Watch`).

## Correctness of the mechanism stays with Quint

A mitigation's own logic (a budget's accounting, a limiter's cap) is
ordinary code with ordinary bugs. Record its steps and check them against
a small model with the bound as an invariant (`retries*1000 <=
RATIO*requests`). A broken budget can pass every load test, because
storms are rare and short, while the model rejects its first wrong step.
See examples/retrystorm (`retry/`, `model/retry.qnt`).

## What the examples found

- examples/retrystorm, one server at 10/s with a 9 s timeout and 3
  retries:
  - immediate retries are metastable from about 9 req/s;
  - backoff alone made recovery worse;
  - a budget (a retry per 10 requests) recovered from every trigger
    tried.
- examples/crossdb (a Crossplane provider, 600 objects, a cloud API at
  20 calls/s):
  - crossplane-runtime's requeue (per-item backoff to 60 s, a global limit
    of 10 reconciles/s) recovers from capacity dips;
  - a fixed 1 s requeue on error does not;
  - the global limit alone saves it.
- examples/checkout (the saga itself, a provider at 5 captures/s with a
  1 s timeout):
  - 6 or more payment consumers collapse with no trigger;
  - a retry budget is bypassed by broker redelivery;
  - shedding expired calls at the provider recovers;
  - idempotency keys hold through the storm, and without them the storm
    alone charges twice.
