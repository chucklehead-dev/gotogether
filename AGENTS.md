# AGENTS.md: working on gotogether

Guidance for coding agents (and humans) changing this repository. If you
are *using* the toolkit in another project, the skills in `skills/` are
for you (`gotogether skills install`).

## What this is

A Go toolkit for checking Go code against Quint models in four ways, and
its load behaviour in a fifth:
- **MBT** (`connect`): Quint traces drive the code.
- **Hegel integration** (`qhegel`): Hegel drives and the model
  judges, or the model drives and Hegel varies.
- **Trace validation** (`qobs`, `qtrace`, `otelio`, `convert`, `binding`,
  `validate`, `qtest`): recorded runs are checked by the model.
- **Simulated environments** (`qenv`, `System.Explore`): the system runs
  deterministically against fault-injecting doubles, every choice made by
  Hegel or a seed, every run checked by the model.
- **Metastability** (`qload`, `qmeta`): whether a system recovers after a
  load spike or capacity dip. A CTMC predicts it, a load simulation on qenv
  confirms it, and Hegel shrinks the smallest trigger.

The design record is `docs/DESIGN.md`. Read §9 before changing `connect`
or `qhegel`, §10 before changing `qenv`, and §11 before changing
`qload` or `qmeta`.

## Requirements and commands

- The published modules (the core, qhegel, qweave, qanalysis, qgosim)
  have no `replace`: `go install …@version` refuses one, and a
  dependency's is ignored. They require each other at pushed commits
  (pseudo-versions, until tags). A change to the core that another
  published module needs: push it, then `go get
  github.com/chucklehead-dev/gotogether@<commit>` in that module (GOWORK=off)
  and push again; until then CI tests the module against the older core.
  Examples are not published and keep `replace => ../..`.
  Tags, when the maintainer says: gosim (its own repository) first, then
  the core, qweave, qhegel, qanalysis and qgosim, each module's tag
  prefixed with its directory (`qhegel/v0.1.0`), and each module's
  requirements moved from pseudo-versions to the tags.
- Each published module's exported API is recorded in api/<module>.txt
  (api/core.txt, api/qhegel.txt, ...): every exported function, type,
  field, method, interface method, constant and variable, as declared,
  read with go/ast by the core's internal/apisurface (an alias of an
  internal type, qenv.Rates, carries that type's fields and methods). A
  deliberate change to any of them regenerates it (`GOTOGETHER_UPDATE_API=1
  go test ./internal/apisurface/`, from the root) and adds a CHANGELOG
  line.
- The repository is a Go workspace (`go.work`, checked in): every module
  sees the others' code as it is, without a release. CI sets `GOWORK=off`
  and tests each module on its own go.mod, as a user would build it.
- Go ≥ 1.26.1 (`go.mod`; hegel-go needs it). quint ≥ 0.32 on PATH
  (`npm i -g @informalsystems/quint`, then `QUINT_VERSION=0.33.0
  ci/install-quint.sh` for the Rust evaluator). Tests that need quint
  skip without it.
- `go vet ./... && gofmt -l .`: both must be clean.
- `go test -short ./...` takes ~1 min. `go test ./...` adds the
  shrinking-against-the-model tests, ~3–4 min. Both cover the root
  module only: every example is a module, tested in its directory (`cd
  examples/hello && go test ./...`; CI loops over them).
- edgepublish (its own module):
  ```sh
  cd examples/edgepublish
  go test ./...
  go run github.com/DataDog/orchestrion go test ./mbt/ ./scenarios/   # woven
  ```
- gosim (qgosim and examples/gosim, their own modules): `cd examples/gosim
  && GOWORK=off go test -p 1 -short ./...`, as CI runs it (the first run
  translates the standard library, about a minute). In the workspace
  (GOWORK unset) gosim's translation cannot find the module's packages
  and every test fails with "package translated/... is not in std". Check the simulated side with
  `go vet -tags sim`.
- qanalysis (its own module): `cd qanalysis && go test ./...` (the checkout
  comparison weaves and explores checkout: skipped with -short, needs quint).
- grpcledger and streams (their own modules): `cd examples/<name> && go test ./...`.
  grpcledger's generated protobuf code is checked in; regenerate with buf
  (no protoc: see its README).
- fleetrollout (its own module): `cd examples/fleetrollout && go test ./...`;
  `./kwok-demo.sh` needs kwokctl and kwok on PATH (`go install
  sigs.k8s.io/kwok/cmd/{kwokctl,kwok}@v0.7.0`), no Docker (binary runtime).
- crossdb (its own module): `cd examples/crossdb && go test ./...`; `kind/demo.sh`
  needs Docker, kind, kubectl and helm (`kind/setup.sh` installs Crossplane;
  `CA_BUNDLE=` for a TLS-intercepting proxy). CRD and deepcopy are generated:
  `go run sigs.k8s.io/controller-tools/cmd/controller-gen@v0.19.0 object crd paths=./apis/... output:crd:dir=./package/crds`.
- Backend: `QUINT_BACKEND=rust|typescript`, for connect, validate and
  qtest alike (unset: rust for a single validation, typescript for a
  batch chunk of several traces, which it evaluates in one process where
  rust starts one evaluator per test; quint's own default for connect's
  `quint run`).
  `GOTOGETHER_KEEP=/dir` keeps generated modules and traces from qtest and
  qhegel. `GOTOGETHER_RUN='TestX#2:seed=n'` (or `:schedule=...`,
  `:corpus=<file>`) runs one run of one exploration alone, the test's
  explorations numbered in order; each failing run's report prints it.
  `GOTOGETHER_EVIDENCE=dir` writes each exploration's evidence
  (`gotogether.evidence/1`, with its role: faithful, mutant, replay) as
  dir/<test>/x<N>.json, cleared per test; a System's `Mutant` marks a
  config's mutation so the suite's gaps leave it out.
  `GOTOGETHER_CORPUS=dir`
  replays and saves explorations' corpus entries under dir/<test>;
  `GOTOGETHER_HEGEL_SEED=n|random` overrides qhegel searches' seeds
  (both nightly). `GOTOGETHER_VERBOSE=1` shows
  Hegel's output for expected failures (FindViolation and Shrink capture
  os.Stdout while Hegel runs, since Hegel writes nowhere else).

## Conventions

- The spec is ground truth. A failing model test means fixing the code
  or, deliberately and visibly, the model. Never loosen a check to get
  green.
- Error messages say what to do next: name the step, the action and its
  picks, the field, and the fix (see `connect`'s "anonymous action" and
  "no mbt::actionTaken" errors). Tests assert on these messages, so keep
  them stable.
- Keep the core free of heavy dependencies: OTel and yaml.v3 only. Hegel
  (and purego, which it loads) is qhegel's, a module of its own, so a
  program that records steps does not depend on it; a core test that
  needs Hegel lives in internal/hegelprops, a module of its own that
  replaces the core with the checkout. Orchestrion stays in examples.
- Any `//quint:action` expression may only use parameters, the receiver
  and named results. Methods called only from annotations (like
  `Publisher.actor`) look unused to linters: mark them, don't delete them.
- Comments explain why, at the density of the surrounding code. Doc
  comments on every exported identifier.
- New user-facing behaviour gets:
  - a test (against `connect/testdata/bank.qnt` or
    `examples/bank/model/bank.qnt`, or a model in `testdata/`);
  - a line in README.md if it is a new entry point;
  - an update to the relevant skill in `skills/` if agents should use it.
  `skills/skills_test.go` checks the skills' front matter.
- quint invocations go through argv (never a shell). Pass absolute spec
  paths and set `cmd.Dir` to the spec's directory.
- Timing-sensitive or slow tests (shrinking against the model) skip under
  `testing.Short()`.
- A skill's mechanics (how to weave, gosim, sweeps, coverage) go in
  `skills/<name>/references/*.md`, linked from its SKILL.md with when to
  read each; verdicts and expectations are in
  `gotogether-workflow/references/verdicts.md`. `skills_test.go`
  checks every link resolves, and fails on removed identifiers and old
  names in the skills, README.md, AGENTS.md and the examples' READMEs
  (`TestSkillsAvoidDeprecated` lists them): when removing an API, add it
  there.
- Skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, never directly in `.agents/` or
  `.claude/`, which only hold symlinks to them. Add a symlink in both when
  adding a skill (`skills_test.go` checks it). A skill's front-matter
  `name` equals its directory.
- An example app has a model in `model/`, a binding, at least one
  mutant, a `run-demo.sh`, tests showing which check catches which
  mutant, and a README with the table of tests. Its row goes in the
  README's example table. State expected verdicts with `qtest.Expect`
  (`Rejects`, `Mismatch`, `Violates`; over runs, `Some`, `All`, `None`)
  and expected Hegel failures with `qhegel.FindViolation(...).Expect`,
  not by hand: no string matching on summaries, no walks of reports.
  Bindings give templates only where a parameter is not the same-named
  step field.

## Gotchas

- `quint run --mbt` records every `nondet` evaluated in a step, not only
  the action's own: picks of other actions appear as `Some(..)`.
- `quint test` ITF has no `mbt::` variables.
- Generated replay modules import the model by relative path from their
  own directory. Moving a generated `.qnt` breaks its import.
- A model with no constants must be imported as `import M.*`, not `M()`
  (`binding.RenderModule` handles this).
- Hegel's `TestCase.Errorf` aborts the test case (unlike `testing.T`).
  `hegel.Test` cannot express "expected to fail": use `hegel.Run`.
- Choreo models (examples/twophase): Choreo's `step` picks a node and a
  transition, which no recorded step or `--mbt` trace can name. Give each
  transition a named action of its node (`choreo::step_with(node, f, ...)`)
  and choose among them in `step`. `choreo::s` is not visible outside the
  model's module: bindings and runs read state through a def
  (`stage(n)`). connect's `StatePath: [s, system]` reaches the nodes (the
  `m::choreo::` qualifiers are stripped).
- quintaction's scope check uses `LookupParent(name, body.Lbrace)`:
  go/types declares a function body's top-level locals in the same scope
  as its parameters, so a lookup without the position finds locals.
  Its analysistest fixtures are GOPATH-style with stub qenv and qobs
  packages (`qanalysis/testdata/src/github.com/...`): keep the stubs to
  what the fixtures use. An expectation on a `//quint:action` line goes
  in a block comment before the directive.
- actionmap stops at functions outside the loaded packages: a library
  that calls back (qenv's commit hooks) is one call-graph node for every
  closure handed to it, and going through it made cancel "reach"
  PlaceOrder.
- A step for a refusal recorded with `Txn.OnCommit` needs the transaction
  to commit: return nil from it and the error after `qenv.Retry`
  (checkout's `PlaceOrder`). An error rolls back and drops the hook.
- `qenv.Store` detects lock-wait cycles: the transaction whose
  `GetForUpdate` would close one aborts with `ErrDeadlock` (an
  ErrConflict). `qenv.Service` lets a crash fall between the handler's
  return and the response's delivery (the effect committed, the caller
  never told) unless `NoCrashWindow` is set; the window is a scheduling
  point, so choices recorded before it was the default do not replay.
- An expectation naming an action the model lacks, or an invariant the
  runs did not check, fails the test (a misspelled `None(Violates(x))`
  would otherwise hold for nothing). Verdicts are cached per instance
  (binding, constants, invariants), not per steps alone.
- A binding template's `.seq` and `.action` are the step's own unless the
  step has an argument of that name, which wins; the step's are always
  `.step.seq`, `.step.action`. `.process`, `.outcome`, `.obs`, `.step` and
  `.args` are always the step's: every argument is also `.args.X`, and a
  parameter of a reserved name defaults to it (`{{.args.process}}`).
- A step's observed values may be negative (an overdraft's balance): never
  use -1 as "not observed". Pass the observation or nothing.
- `quint` reserves `to` (and other built-in names): a parameter named `to`
  fails to parse (QNT101). grpcledger's model says `src`/`dest`.
- A crashable process whose restart redoes its whole job (a publisher that
  republishes everything) livelocks a run under per-step crash rates:
  every restart adds work at the same virtual instant. Give it durable
  progress (an outbox it clears on acknowledgement), as a real one has.
- Outside a simulation `qenv.Wait` polls its predicate in real time and
  `Signal.Wait` waits on a channel `Notify` closes (they panicked once): a
  seam's code runs unchanged with a real client, whose goroutines notify.
  The predicate must then be safe to call concurrently.
- `Sim.Run` returns `ErrStuck` (naming the tasks) when nothing can run, no
  deadline is set and a task still waits: a stalled run once looked
  quiet. A task that may wait forever (a server's loop, a sender waiting
  for records) calls `qenv.Daemon(ctx)`; a double's receive uses
  `qenv.WaitIdle`. The native runtime runs in real time and cannot tell.
- `qrun.Start(ctx)` makes ctx the goroutine's run without a simulation
  (`qtest.Record`, `qhegel.Case.Install`), and `qenv.New` inherits
  it. Goroutines the run starts are not in it: their steps fail Record
  (the run is strict) unless it is given `qtest.Global()` (in
  qhegel's `Config.Opts` too), which installs the global recorder for
  them (`qobs.InstallGlobal`). A second install while one is in place fails,
  so such tests must not run in parallel; a restore puts back the
  previous recorder only if its own is still installed.
- A model that learns a log from its reads checks Kafka, Kinesis and a
  simulated log with one binding (examples/streams): the consumer is the
  one place every tier can record.
- Long replays are split into `.then` segments of 20 (`binding.segmentSteps`):
  Quint's Rust evaluator rejects chains nested much past 50. A disabled
  last step is reported by quint as QNT511 at the run's own line, and a
  segment ending in one at the `.then(segK)` line. The validator maps both,
  and `validate/segments_test.go` covers them.
- A failed quint test with no error position is a tool failure (e.g. the
  evaluator crashed). The validator returns an error, never a verdict.
- Distributed examples order steps across nodes with a Lamport clock
  (`order.lamport`). Domain-clock steps with equal values are concurrent,
  and every one of them precedes every step with a larger value
  (`qtrace` links whole groups, not neighbours). A service's operations
  are recorded at the service, where they take effect.
- qenv runs are deterministic only if all nondeterminism goes through the
  Chooser: code under test must use `qenv.Go`, `qenv.Now`, `qenv.Sleep` and
  the doubles, and iterate maps in sorted order where the order matters.
  `qenv.Replay` stops at the first divergence and reports it (`Err`, the
  run's error in an exploration). `EncodeChoices` writes the byte
  rule's version (`qenv.BytesVersion`): bump it when the rule changes,
  and old corpus entries fail with the fix instead of replaying another
  run.
- A fault point's options are nominal, then its errors in the order
  named, then the crash (`qenv.FaultPoint`, which declares them as its
  kind: the errors' FaultName or text, and `crash`, nominal outside a
  process). A Script's or a trace's option numbers depend on that order:
  keep it. One kind has one option list: two sites of a kind with other
  errors panic in `qenv.DeclareFaults`; give them their own kinds. A scripted crash is a
  nemesis by name (`nemesis.crash.<process>`): the scheduler asks a
  chooser with `ChooseNemesis` instead of choosing among enabled
  nemeses by index, which no trace can name.
- A run's state (its recorder, role registry, coverage counts) is found
  through `qrun`: the context, else the goroutine's run (qenv's
  resolver). A new kind of per-run state is a `qrun.Key`, never a
  package-level default that runs in parallel would share.
- `qweave -cover` instruments the main module only, never the toolkit's
  own packages (examples aside): qcover's `Hit` would count itself. A
  block's code is attributed to its task's next step, so a client whose
  step a service records shows as "run by no step": read that list as
  code no step of its own task explains, not as dead code.
- `qweave -mutate` switches mutants through qrun, like `-cover`, so it
  mutates the main module only (or `-coverpkg`). A survivor is often an
  unobserved effect, not unneeded code: a step that records nothing the
  binding compares (checkout's cancel never carried the stock). Mutants
  equivalent under the environment (dropped acks, retries' boundaries)
  survive by right: read the report, do not assert a score.
- A Script's faults are in a partial order: each kind's in order, other
  kinds independent unless a fault `Follows` them (connect.FaultScript
  chains a trace's faults; an ordered pair says b follows a). It was a
  strict order, where a fault of a phase that had passed (checkout's API
  faults happen only while orders are placed) blocked every later one.
- A chooser that wraps another implements `Unwrap() qenv.Chooser`
  (`qenv.Wrapper`): `New`, `ContextOf`, `EntropyOf` and nemeses by name
  look through the chain (`qenv.As[T]`). A wrapper without it hides the
  run's context and entropy.
- A double's fault kinds carry its instance's name (`rpc.<name>.request`,
  `queue.<name>.ack`, `store.<name>.commit`, `disk.<name>.crash`), and a
  double that a partition reaches takes its process at construction
  (`NewService`, `NewQueue`, `NewDisk`): a field set later was forgotten
  and silently kept partitions out. A name that covers nothing declared
  (`qenv.KnownFault`: the process's registry of kinds, options and
  nemeses) matches nothing: an exploration fails on such a Rates key, a
  sweep on such a FaultKind, Exercised on such an exception. Name each
  double uniquely in a simulation: two of one name share their kind.
- A double declares its fault kinds by name (`qenv.DeclareFaults("kube.request",
  "unavailable", "lostResponse")`) and chooses with `Sim.FaultOf`, which
  returns the option's name. A call that cannot fail in some options takes
  a prefix (`k.Only("unavailable")`), so an option's number means one
  thing at every call. Coverage and scripts name options from the
  declaration.
- Users name fault kinds as reports print them, without the chooser's
  `fault.` prefix: Rates keys (`"nemesis"`, `"rpc.payments"`), `Without`,
  `Swarm`, `Reaches`, Script kinds. A prefixed one panics with the fix (it
  once matched nothing, silently). The prefix stays in the Chooser
  protocol (`Choose("fault.<kind>", n)`, a recorded `Choice.Kind`).
- Option 0 of every qenv choice is nominal (no fault, canonical order).
  Keep that convention in new doubles: it is what makes Hegel's shrinking
  remove faults.
- `qhegel.Choices` draws 512-byte chunks (`hegel.Binary(n, n)`), not
  one draw per choice: per-choice draws made a shrinking test 20x slower. A task's
  panic is re-raised by `Sim.Run` with its original value, because Hegel
  aborts a test case by panicking from whichever goroutine draws. qtest's
  explorations recover it (`runOne`) into the run's `*RunPanic` with the
  task's stack (`qenv.WithPanicStack`): a self-check's panic is a failing
  run, named and kept, not the test binary's end. qhegel's own runs do
  not go through `runOne`, so Hegel's aborts reach Hegel.
- A nemesis (crash) is considered at every scheduling step: its rate is
  per step (`DefaultRates` 1 in 200), not per operation. Under load that
  means far more crashes per second: set `Sim.NemesisEvery`
  (`qload.Experiment` does when it injects faults). Each family (the
  name's first segment, a heal a partition's) is its own choice,
  `fault.nemesis.<family>`, at its own rate, considered in turn until one
  acts: one family's nemeses do not dilute another's. A Script's pick by
  name is recorded as those choices, so its run replays; it bypasses a
  Without or Swarm around it, which turns its nemeses off only for other
  choosers. A family a wrapper answers reaches no ChoiceLog inside it:
  `ChoiceLog.Nemeses` lists only what a log was offered.
- Simulated runs record into their own recorder. `System.Explore` runs
  seeds in parallel, each with a recorder in the chooser's context
  (`qenv.WithContext`, `qobs.WithRecorder`). A step without it in its
  context finds its run through its goroutine: qenv registers each
  task's goroutine and the simulation's creator (`qrun`,
  `qenv/goroutine.go`). Explore and Experiment runs are strict
  (`qobs.Strict`), so a step from a goroutine started with `go` fails
  the exploration (`qobs.Escaped`; `Series.Escaped` for an Experiment).
  It once panicked, on a goroutine nothing could recover, killing the
  test binary.
  `gotogether lint -sim .` (in CI) flags `go` statements and wall-clock
  calls in files that import qenv, tests included; `//qenv:ok` exempts a
  line (give the reason after it).
- `//quint:action` arguments split on spaces outside quotes and brackets
  (`obs.balance:b.Balance(ctx, acct)` is one): binding's lint and qweave
  share the rule, tested on `binding/testdata/directives.json`. Change
  both with the table.
- `gotogether lint -binding -src` and quintaction (`-binding`) check literal
  actions passed to `qobs.Record` and `Recorder.Record`, in files that
  import qobs. An action through a constant or variable is not seen, and
  a call on another imported package's `Record` (qtest's) is skipped by
  its name; the analyzer confirms each call by type, the CLI cannot.
- kwok's pod stages given in a cluster's config replace all of its default
  pod stages, not its node stages: `KwokStages` carries kwok's fast
  pod-ready, pod-complete and pod-delete stages with only the delays
  added, one stage per option with weight 1 (kwok picks among matching
  stages by weight; one stage's jitter would be uniform, not the trace's
  quantiles). Trace clusters are `fleet-trace-m*`, so `KEEP=1` never
  reuses a cluster with kwok's immediate stages.
- qenv finds the task of a goroutine when a context carries none: Sleep,
  Wait, Go and recording with `context.Background()` from a task stay in
  its simulation (`taskOf`, `qenv/goroutine.go`). Without that, a woven
  background goroutine's simulated latency slept in real time.
- A task killed by a crash stays frozen while the simulation runs (no
  deferred code runs), and unwinds at `Close`. Steps recorded while it
  unwinds (`//quint:action` records on return) are not in the run: they
  go to `Recorder.Interrupted`, and `System.Explore` reports them with a
  failing run (`qobs.SetDiscard`). A task that crashes its own process
  stops in `Crash`; restart from an `OnCrash` hook.
- A step recorded by the caller on return describes what the caller saw.
  An effect the model must see whether or not its caller survives (a
  write that landed before the crash) belongs at the effect's site: the
  double or service records it.
- Woven code (`qenv/weave`): weaving rewrites calls of `sync` methods in
  the root module and `//qenv:go` go statements. A method value
  (`return st.mu.RUnlock`) or an unmarked `go` escapes, so check with
  `gotogether lint -weave DIR`. So does a promoted call through an embedded
  `sync.Mutex` (`t.Lock()` on `struct{ sync.Mutex }`): Orchestrion
  matches the receiver's type, so name the field. The lint flags the
  embedding. Inside a simulation, every user of a woven
  object must be one of its tasks (call `Close` from a task, not from the
  test goroutine). Woven calls look up the goroutine (about 1 µs), so
  weave test builds only.
- Run qenv's tests, and tests of new doubles, with `GOTOGETHER_CHECK=1`: the
  scheduler checks its invariants at every step, and every `Store` checks
  each commit's dependency cycles against its isolation level
  (`qenv/internal/history`: G1a, G1c, G-single, G2). CI does, and runs
  the store's examples so too. A change to the store's validation that
  lets a forbidden cycle commit panics there, naming the cycle. Every
  `Queue` checks its contract after each operation: no message lost, none
  delivered after its acknowledgement, an Ordered queue's first
  deliveries in order.
- A recovery verdict needs a healthy baseline (`Experiment.Healthy`):
  without one `Assess` returns `Recovery.Err`, since a system already
  collapsed before the trigger would "recover" to its collapsed goodput.
- Libraries that read the real clock (crossplane-runtime's create
  annotations and grace period) see no virtual time passing. Translate
  their timestamps at the seam (`Sim.ToVirtual` on write, `Sim.ToReal` on
  read: crossdb's kube interceptor), or their time-based logic is not
  exercised (a grace period that never expires blocked every deletion).
- One thread per goroutine when recording with a domain clock: a thread
  asserts program order, and goroutines sharing one contradict it
  (`issue: error cycle`).
- `FileSink` survives a killed process (one write per step, no buffer),
  not a power loss: the OS may not have written the last steps back, and
  the line being written can be torn (`qenv.Disk` shows both).
  `SyncedFileSink` fsyncs each step. `BufferedFileSink` buffers, and a
  killed process loses its last steps, undetectably: use it only where
  nothing crashes. `qtrace.ReadJSONL` keeps the steps before a torn last
  line and returns a `*TornTail` (input.File.Torn; validate warns).
- A `qenv.Signal` waiter is tagged with the task's wait generation; a
  timed-out wait must not be woken by a later `Notify` (it once shortened
  the next sleep). Keep the tag when touching the scheduler.
- qload metrics are time series of rates; sample counters reset every
  tick. `Sample.Orbit` is known only in hindsight (an attempt is in the
  orbit from its start if it times out) and is filled when the run ends.
- Two v's: the chain's orbit (`qload.Sample.Orbit`, in hindsight:
  attempts that will time out, and requests waiting to retry) and what a
  running system sees (`qrole`'s `Orbit`, `Sample.Waiting`: the waiting
  part). Under immediate retries the second stays at 0 through a storm
  (`TestTwoOrbits`): alerts on it see only u.
- An alert region is defined by the probability of recovering within the
  bound (`RecoveryWithin`), not the mean hitting time, which near a storm
  is dominated by rare tips into it. Calibrate a running system with
  `CalibrateTimeout` (λ held): a fit of λ to storm data drives it to μ.
- The chain's service is exponential. A measured service time far from
  it (`qmeta.Measure(...).Exponential()` false) changes verdicts, not
  just numbers. Constant service made a queue longer than μ × timeout
  absorbing (every request in it times out), where exponential service
  drains it: check such verdicts in a simulation with `Service.Draw`.
- `qmeta`'s chain ranks policies; its absolute times are not the
  simulation's. Keep its orbit bound well above the storm's size, and
  assert orderings or orders of magnitude, not seconds.
- Controllers are closed loops (`ClientConfig.Population`). An open-loop
  abstraction double-counts a failing object's polls and finds storms
  that cannot happen.
- qhegel's case checker (`caseChecker`): prefix reuse is only sound for one actor with
  no `order.*` keys, where the recording order is the reconstructed order,
  and with equal instance constants. Keep those guards.
- gosim (`qgosim`, `examples/gosim`) translates everything the simulated
  package imports: keep Hegel and other native code out of it. Hegel
  adapters live in qhegel (`Chooser`, `FindTrigger`), and the Glomers one in `maelstrom/hegelnet`, never
  next to code a simulation runs. `internal/simdeps` fails if qenv, qobs,
  qtrace, qload, qmeta, any package that imports qenv (qhegel aside)
  or a simulated example depends on Hegel, purego or cgo, and names the
  import chain. It writes the
  translation into the module's `.gosim/`, which `gofmt -l .` at the root
  reports: it is gitignored, ignore it.
- qenv's native runtime (`qenv.NewNative`) keeps one-task-at-a-time
  semantics with a lock the running task gives up at seams, and a
  condition variable broadcast when it does. A waiter that wakes and is
  not ready must not broadcast again: two waiters would wake each other
  forever, and gosim's virtual time would never pass. Its processes'
  tasks start on the process's machine (a spawn queue its main goroutine
  serves), and a machine crash is requested before the crash hooks run,
  which may restart it.
- Without a Platform, the native runtime's `Close` waits for every
  task's goroutine to exit (a sleep ends at Close), so a simulation in a
  `testing/synctest` bubble leaves none behind (the bubble panics if one
  remains). A task blocked outside a seam (a real lock, a channel) would
  hang Close: keep tasks' waits in qenv's seams.
- The gosim fork is its own module, github.com/chucklehead-dev/gosim:
  upstream history plus our commits, its `FORK.md` saying what they
  change. Change the fork there, push, then bump qgosim's and
  examples/gosim's requirement (`go get github.com/chucklehead-dev/gosim@<commit>`).
  It translates one Go release's standard library (Go 1.26) and refuses
  another. Choosers with entropy
  (`qenv.EntropyOf`: Seeded, qhegel.Choices, a ChoiceLog or Replay of
  them) hand gosim bytes in chunks for every choice but faults. A chooser
  without it (a plain wrapper) falls back to one round trip per choice,
  about 9 times slower.
- Weaving is qweave's (its own module, x/tools): `qweave go test ./...`
  weaves the package graph with the aspects of the packages the tool file
  imports and runs the go command with `-overlay`; qgosim hands gosim the
  same overlay (`GOSIM_OVERLAY`). For gosim, the module's `gosim.tool.go`
  (else `orchestrion.tool.go`) names them: list qobs for `//quint:action`,
  never qenv/weave (gosim simulates sync itself). qweave weaves method
  values and promoted calls that Orchestrion misses; `gotogether lint -weave`
  is about Orchestrion builds. A new join point or advice goes in
  `qweave/weave.go`, with a fixture test. On the native runtime with a
  Platform, qenv takes no lock across user code (gosim is cooperative):
  never put a real lock or a multi-send loop where a crash or a goroutine
  switch could strand it (DESIGN §15.8), and compare times without
  monotonic readings (`Sim.Now` already drops them).
