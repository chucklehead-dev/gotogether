# Design: model-based testing and runtime conformance for Go against Quint

This is the design record of the `quintgo` spike, which started in
casselc/observability (`quintgo/`, against the otel-chdb models) and moved
here as quint-connect-go, now gotogether. Sections 1–8 are the spike's research and
decisions, lightly edited for the new layout (the edgePublish model is
vendored in `examples/edgepublish/model`). Section 9 covers what was added
in the move: quint-connect parity for `connect`, the Hegel integration,
and span conversion.

The spike's verification ran on Go 1.25, Quint 0.32 (`--backend
typescript`) and Orchestrion v1.13.1. The migrated code is tested with
Go 1.26, Quint 0.33 (both backends) and hegel-go v0.9.27. Anything marked
**speculative** or **unverified** was not run.

The ask had two parts:

1. **MBT for Go**, like quint-llm-kit's quint-connect flow for Rust: drive Go
   code from Quint traces and compare states; possibly via comment
   annotations, code generation or Orchestrion.
2. **Runtime conformance à la PObserve**: the running Go program emits the
   model-relevant facts as OpenTelemetry span events, a reconstructor turns
   live telemetry into a model trace, and that trace is checked against the
   Quint model: that each transition is valid, and the invariants.

Two later requirements: the toolkit must be generic (edgePublish is the first
binding, not the only target), and usable as a Go library from tests, e.g.
property-based state-machine tests. A third came after review: running apps
must be able to emit a checkable trace directly, without reconstructing it
from OTel spans, for tests, simulations, deterministic replays and CI. §6b
covers it.

## 1. Prior art

### quint-connect and the kit (Rust)

- **Trace generation.** Quint produces traces: `quint run --mbt` (random
  simulation) or a deterministic `run` test. `--mbt` adds two fields to every
  ITF state: `mbt::actionTaken`, the innermost action that fired, and
  `mbt::nondetPicks`, a record of `Option`s holding each `nondet` value
  picked on the way. (Checked on edgePublish: `writeTable` shows up with
  picks `x`, `o`, and also the step-level picks `w` and `p` that it did not use.)
- **Driver.** `quint-connect` is a Rust crate. `#[quint_test(spec, test, main)]`
  replays a named `run`; `#[quint_run(spec)]` replays random simulations. Both
  call the Quint CLI to get ITF. The user implements a `Driver`:
  `step(&mut self, &Step)` dispatches on the action with the `switch!` macro,
  as in `switch!(step { init => self.init(), MyAction(a, b?) => self.my_action(a, b) })`,
  and a state check compares the spec state (`step.get_in(path)`, deserialised
  with `itf`/serde) with the implementation's, converted with `From`.
  `QUINT_SEED` and `QUINT_VERBOSE` control reproduction.
- **The kit.** `agentic/scripts/quint_connect/project_scaffold.py` runs
  `quint compile --flatten false`, derives Rust types from the spec's type
  declarations, and fills templates (`driver.rs`, `state.rs`,
  `transition.rs`, `types.rs`). The templates assume a Choreo-style spec,
  where the state is `s.system` per process and each transition has a
  `transition.label`. The `mbt-validator` agent then adds one transition per
  TDD cycle: run the test, see "Unimplemented action", add the label, the
  `switch!` arm and a handler that asserts every effect the spec emits, and
  stop. The rule throughout: the spec is ground truth; fix the code, not the
  test. The template pins a private quint-connect branch named
  `connect-and-observe`, a hint that Informal is working on the observation
  direction as well (**speculative**).
- **Quint's docs** list "trace validation" as the inverse of MBT: production
  data, model expectations. They have not written that page yet.

### PObserve (P language, AWS)

A log parser turns each log line into `PObserveEvent{key, timestamp, event,
logLine, customPayload}`. A **sequencer** sorts events by timestamp into one
global stream. A **demultiplexer** routes them by `key` to instances of P
spec monitors, which assert safety (and bounded liveness) over the events
they observe. PObserve runs post hoc, on logs, in test and in production. Its
monitors are hand-written P `spec` machines that watch events; they do not
replay the system model.

What gotogether keeps from it:
- partition keys: `quint.actor`;
- post-hoc checking of real telemetry.

What it changes:
- It replays the model's own transitions, so it checks membership in the
  model and the model's invariants. No separate monitor has to be written.
- Ordering does not trust wall clocks, which is PObserve's weak point:
  see §4.

## 2. Options for Go

| | Annotations + codegen (`go generate`) | **Orchestrion aspects** (`//quint:action`) | Library only (`qobs.Record`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Code change | comment, plus generated wrappers the code must call, or a rewritten copy of the source | a comment on a function | one call per step |
| Build | extra generate step; generated files to keep in sync | `orchestrion go build` / `go test`; a plain build ignores it | none |
| Off by default | only with build tags | **yes**: without Orchestrion the comment is inert and the binary is unchanged | needs a runtime switch (`qobs.SetGlobal(nil)` makes it about 22 ns a call) |
| Granularity | function | function (statement level is possible, **unverified**, see below) | any statement |
| Timing of the step | wrapper returns | function returns (deferred advice) | wherever the call is |
| Tooling cost | a Go AST rewriter to write and maintain | none (the aspect is 70 lines of YAML/template, and already written) | none |
| Build time | small | cold ~70 s (it weaves the standard library too), warm ~2 s | none |

**Recommendation: Orchestrion for the annotations, with qobs as the library
under it.** The directive is the whole integration. It costs nothing unless
you build with Orchestrion, and it is generic: the aspect ships with qobs, not
with the project. The library path stays open for steps that are not
function-shaped, and for tests that record explicitly. A `go generate`
rewriter would be a less capable Orchestrion that we would have to maintain
ourselves.

What makes it "generated from the model" is not advice generation. The
aspect needs nothing model-specific. The model drives:
- `gotogether scaffold`: a binding skeleton, with every action's signature taken
  from `quint typecheck`;
- `gotogether lint`: the binding against the model (action names, parameter
  names, constants, invariants), and the Go annotations against the binding
  (every field a template uses must be recorded).

Rules the annotation route imposes, learned in this spike:
- **Function granularity.** A model step must be a function whose return is
  the step's linearization point. In the stand-in, the three S3 writes, the
  batch start and the rotation are small functions. In the real
  `publish.go`, `writeParquet` and `seal` already are. The table insert and
  the manifest write are inline in a closure, and the rotation is inside
  `acquire`. Orchestrion's `directive` join point also matches expressions
  inside an annotated statement, so a statement-level `//quint:step` that
  wraps a call expression looks feasible. **Unverified**: not built.
- **What an expression may use.** Advice runs deferred at return, so an
  annotation may use parameters, the receiver and named results, but not
  locals.
- **Record before spawning dependent work.** Recording at return is correct
  only if nothing that depends on the step was started inside the function.
  The stand-in's `rotate` records before `acquire` starts the background
  seal. Otherwise the seal's step could be recorded before the rotation's,
  and the model has no seal of an unrotated generation.

## 3. Telemetry schema (generic)

One span event per model step, named `quint.step`, on a short span
`quint <action>` that is a child of the span in the context. Attributes are
on the event. For the non-argument keys, readers fall back to the span's and
then the resource's attributes, so a deployment can hoist e.g.
`quint.process` into the resource.

| Attribute | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `quint.action` | string | model action name (required) |
| `quint.seq` | int | per-recorder sequence number, **dense** (1, 2, 3, …): a hole means a lost step |
| `quint.recorder` | string | id of the recorder, the scope of `quint.seq` |
| `quint.actor` | string | partition key: which model instance the step belongs to (e.g. `edge-1/traces`) |
| `quint.process` | string | incarnation of the actor (e.g. the producer epoch); a change means the process restarted |
| `quint.thread` | string | program-order key: steps with the same thread are totally ordered by seq (default: the qobs thread in ctx, else the parent span id) |
| `quint.outcome` | string | `ok`, `error`, or an error's own classification (`QuintOutcome() string`, e.g. `ambiguous`) |
| `quint.error` | string | error text |
| `quint.arg.<name>` | string, int, bool, double | an observed parameter, in implementation terms (ids, not model values) |
| `quint.obs.<name>` | same | an observed projection of the post-state (e.g. `obs.batches`: what `_sealed.json` said) |
| `quint.order.<domain>` | int | a domain logical clock: steps of one (actor, process) that share the domain are ordered by its value |

Observations stay in implementation terms. The binding holds the
abstraction function (interning, templates), so the same telemetry can be
checked against another model or design without redeploying.

**Sampling.** Step spans must not be sampled out. qobs takes its own
TracerProvider, and the demo uses `AlwaysSample`. With parent-based sampling,
a step under an unsampled request would be lost, so give qobs a provider of
its own. A dropped export, or a BatchSpanProcessor dropping on a full queue,
shows up as a seq gap. The validator reports it as an `error` issue: the
verdict is unsound. **Not built:** carrying steps as OTel log records
instead, which pipelines usually do not sample.

## 4. Reconstruction (`qtrace.Reconstruct`)

Input: an unordered bag of steps from any number of recorders, processes and
actors (OTLP/JSON files, or in-memory SDK spans).

1. **Dedupe** on (recorder, seq): exporters retry and collectors fan out.
2. **Gap detection.** seq is dense per recorder. Any hole is an `error`
   issue for every actor that recorder reported.
3. **Partition by `quint.actor`.** Each actor is replayed as its own model
   instance, like PObserve's key. Actors that share one model instance, such
   as edgePublish's writer and consumer, need the cross-process edges below.
4. **Order** each actor's steps by a topological sort of a happens-before
   graph:
   - hard edges, **program order**: steps with the same `quint.thread`, by seq;
   - hard edges, **domain clocks**: steps with the same
     `quint.order.<d>` in one (actor, process), by value. Example: batch ids
     come from an atomic counter, so their order is the order pushes
     started, even when the `pushStart` steps were recorded in the other
     order. The seq alone cannot be a hard edge: the id allocation and the
     recording are not one atomic moment. Treating seq as a hard edge next
     to the domain clock produces cycles (there is a unit test);
   - **preference** among steps with no hard edge between them: recording
     order, i.e. seq within a recorder and time across recorders, with time
     made monotone per recorder. Such steps were concurrent. Choosing either
     order is sound when their model actions commute, and the model's
     interleaving semantics already requires that of steps on disjoint state
     (e.g. two pushes' writes). If a recording A happens-before a recording
     B in the Go memory model, then seq(A) < seq(B), so causality inside a
     process that passes through a recorder is preserved;
   - a **cycle** (contradictory keys) is reported and broken at the
     earliest step.
5. **Incarnations.** Processes are numbered in order of first appearance.
   A process change becomes the binding's `restart` action (`crash` for
   edgePublish), the step a dead process cannot report. If the steps of two
   incarnations interleave, that is an `overlap` error: two writers alive at
   once, which the model does not allow (it was a warning, and the old
   incarnation's step replayed as a third boot). The round trip in §6 caught a driver
   bug this way.
6. **Missing information.**
   - A missing step: a gap, reported.
   - A missing field: the template fails, naming the step.
   - An unobserved variable: the model computes it. Replay is a deterministic
     `run`, so the model fills in every hidden variable. Here that is the
     queue, the in-flight pushes, and the consumer, which stays at init.

Across processes (**not built**): the writer–consumer link would be a hard
edge from `writeManifest` to the `claim` that read that manifest. Carry the
writer's `traceparent` in the manifest JSON and emit a span link. This is
the one ordering fact wall clocks cannot supply.

## 5. Validation (`binding` + `validate`)

The binding generates a Quint module per actor:

```quint
module observed {
  import edgePublish(PAYLOADS = Set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), MAX_BATCH = 5, MAX_GEN = 2, ..., CRASHES = true).* from "../../model/edgePublish"
  pure def px(...) = ...                       // binding defs
  run conformsTest =
    init
    // [9] seq 10 epoch-A pushStart(batch=4, gen=g20260924T100000, payload=req-1)
    .then(pushStart(2).expect(writer.pushes.contains(px(2, 1, 4, 1, Encoded))))
    // [15] seq 16 epoch-A rotateGen(gen=g20260924T100000)
    .then(rotateGen.expect(writer.rotated.contains({ epoch: 1, gen: 1 })))
    ...
  run sealMatchesManifestsInvTest = init.expect(sealMatchesManifests).then(pushStart(1).expect(sealMatchesManifests))...
}
```

`quint test --max-samples 1 --out-itf` runs it. Each step is on its own line,
so quint's error position maps back to the observed step (the test-time
`LineStep` table). Nested `A.expect(P)` inside `.then(...)` pinpoints the step
precisely. A top-level `.expect` would only point at the whole chain. Verdicts:

- **disabled** (QNT513, or QNT508 "Cannot continue to expect"): the model
  cannot take the observed step from the state it reached. The
  implementation did something the design does not allow.
- **state** (QNT508 in `conformsTest`): the step was possible, but the
  observed projection (`expect`) does not hold. The implementation's choice
  (a batch id, a generation, a seal's count) differs from the model's.
- **invariant**: the trace conforms, but a model invariant fails on it. This
  is a behaviour the design allows and the design's own properties reject.
  It is the model's known bug, happening in the implementation.
- **issues** from reconstruction (gaps, cycles, overlaps) make a pass
  unsound.

A conforming run's ITF has the module prefixes stripped, and
`mbt::actionTaken` and `mbt::observedSeq` added, so the ITF viewer and
trace tools read it.

**Binding conventions**: what a model needs to be checkable this way.
- Actions parameterised by values that can be observed or derived. A value
  the model picks internally, such as the batch id in `pushStart(p)`, is
  checked with `expect` instead.
- Opaque ids need an abstraction function. `intern` renames them 1, 2, … by
  first appearance, per actor or per process, which covers ids that name
  things in creation order.
- One parameterless restart action, if processes can restart.
- A non-`ok` outcome must mean something: `outcomes` maps it to a model value
  used as `{{.outcome}}`, or to `skip` or `call` per action. If a failed step
  hits an action whose templates ignore `.outcome`, generation stops, so a
  failure is never replayed as a success. This rule came from the round
  trip: a failed seal was being replayed as a seal.
- Constants sized from the trace (`set`, `max`, `procs`), because model bounds
  like `MAX_BATCH` are small.

**Limits of the approach**:
- **Hidden nondeterminism.** The writer cannot tell `Fail` from `Ambiguous`,
  and only a test double knows. With a plain error mapped to `Fail`,
  `ambiguous-seal` would replay as a failed manifest write, and the seal
  undercount would be invisible. It is real in S3, missing in the replay.
  - A deterministic `run` cannot branch. The sound treatment is to replay the
    error as `any { writeManifest(x, Fail), writeManifest(x, Ambiguous) }`
    and ask an exhaustive checker whether some resolution matches every
    later observation, and whether all resolutions satisfy the invariants.
  - That is Apalache: a step-indexed encoding with an `obsIdx` variable, the
    TLA+ trace-validation technique of Cirstea, Kuppe, Merz et al.
    **Not built.**
  - The cheaper route is to observe more. An S3 listing or bucket
    notifications become a second recorder whose steps pin the outcome.
- **Soundness is relative to the binding.** The abstraction function is
  trusted. A wrong template can hide a bug or invent one.
- **Checks are per actor, bounded by the trace, post hoc.** Liveness is not
  checked. Long traces need chunking: validate in windows, starting each
  from the ITF state reached by the previous window (**not built**). The
  typescript backend took 4–8 s per trace of ~30 steps, most of it Node
  start-up.

## 6. Capability 1: driving Go from Quint traces (`connect`)

`connect.Generate` runs `quint run --mbt`. `itf` decodes the result into a
navigable `Value` tree, and `connect.Driver{Init, Actions, Skip, Check}`
replays it. This is the Go counterpart of quint-connect's `Driver` and
`switch!`, with a map standing in for the macro.

The per-project part is the handlers and the state check. For edgePublish
(`examples/edgepublish/mbt`):
- **Scheduling through the effect seam.** Every store write blocks in a gate
  until the handler for that model step releases it with the model's
  outcome (`Ok`/`Fail`/`Ambiguous`). That reproduces the model's
  interleaving of concurrent pushes, S3 faults, rotations and background
  seals exactly, in real goroutines. `crash` releases everything in flight
  as `Fail` and starts a new incarnation.
- **State check.** After every step, the store's table rows, Parquet
  objects, manifests and seals (with batch counts) are compared with the
  model's `tableRows`, `parquet`, `manifests` and `seals`, via learned maps
  from implementation generation ids to model generations.
- **Skipped actions.** The consumer's actions have no implementation here.

Verified: 5 random traces of 30 steps replay against the faithful publisher,
and the manifest-first mutant fails on all 5. Random traces from the full
`step` spend most of their steps in `otherInsert` and consumer actions. A
writer-focused step in the model, or `--step` with a projection, would give
better coverage per trace (roadmap).

**Round trip.** `TestRoundTrip`, under `orchestrion go test`, closes the
loop: model trace → Go → recorded steps → `Checker.Check` → the same model.
5/5 validate. On its first run it found two real problems:
- a driver race: the dead incarnation's seal was recorded after the restart,
  which the reconstructor flagged as an overlap;
- the failed-step-replayed-as-success hole in the binding semantics.

## 6b. Emitting checkable traces directly

The OTel path suits production, where steps ride the telemetry pipeline next
to the app's own traces. Tests, simulations, CI and deterministic replays
need neither the SDK nor a collector. There are two additional paths, and
both are verified with the same verdicts as the OTel path.

**Native step log** (`qobs.JSONLSink` / `FileSink`, `qtrace.ReadJSONL`).
- One JSON object per step, whose keys are exactly the OTel attribute keys of
  §3, plus `quint.time_unix_nano`. Decoding reuses `qtrace.FromAttributes`,
  so the two formats cannot drift apart. It is the same data without the
  span wrapper:
  ```json
  {"quint.action":"writeManifest","quint.actor":"edge-1/traces","quint.arg.batch":1,"quint.arg.gen":"g20260924T100000",
   "quint.arg.payload":"req-1","quint.outcome":"ok","quint.process":"epoch-A","quint.recorder":"20147ffb9e1d",
   "quint.seq":2,"quint.thread":"t1","quint.time_unix_nano":1790292680572863711}
  ```
- It keeps implementation terms, so reconstruction (ordering, gaps,
  restarts) and the binding apply exactly as for spans. A step log can be
  re-checked against another binding.
- `load.Sniff` tells OTLP/JSON (`resourceSpans`), a step log
  (`quint.action`) and ITF (`states`) apart by content, so every command
  takes any of them.

**Model-level ITF** (`binding.Plan` → `StepsToITF` / `ObservedITF`; `validate.ValidateITF`).
- The binding is applied in-process: interning, restarts, outcome mapping and
  instance constants. The trace is written in the shape `quint run --mbt`
  writes, per state:
  - `mbt::actionTaken`;
  - `mbt::nondetPicks`: each parameter as `Some(value)`;
  - `gotogether::expect`: the binding's rendered post-state check;
  - `obs::<name>`: the observed projections.
  `#meta.gotogether` names the spec, module, constants, defs and invariants, so
  the file validates with no binding at hand.
- Turning a template into a pick needs a *value*, not an expression. Without
  a Quint evaluator in Go, argument templates must render to Quint literals.
  `itf.ParseQuint` handles records, `Set`/`List`/`Map`, tuples, constructors,
  ints, strings and bools, and rejects operator calls with a clear message.
  The edgePublish binding moved from `px(...)` to literal records for this.
  Its expects still use `px`.
- Validating an ITF replays `.then(action(picks…))`, matching picks to
  parameters by name. After each step it checks `gotogether::expect` and
  equality for **every model variable the state carries**. So the same code
  validates three kinds of trace:
  - a gotogether-emitted ITF (no model variables; expects only);
  - the enriched ITF of an earlier validation (full model state at every
    step);
  - raw `quint run --mbt` output (`-instance currentDesign`: its constants
    are read from the instance module's source, because Quint does not
    re-export an instance's import).
  Tampering with one variable in one state of a `quint run --mbt` trace is
  reported as a state mismatch at that step. (Verified.)
- Picks are matched by name, which works when the model names its `nondet`
  bindings after the action parameters they feed. edgePublish does. That is
  a convention for the `--mbt` direction, not a guarantee of Quint's.

**Symmetry with `connect`.** A validated run's ITF now carries
`mbt::nondetPicks` next to the model's states, so it has the same shape as
`quint run --mbt` output. `connect.Driver` consumes both.
`scenarios.TestScenarios` replays each observed conforming trace
(`happy`, `rotation-race`, `ambiguous-seal`) through the edgePublish MBT
driver, with store state compared after every step. A trace observed in a
run can be replayed deterministically on a new build. Model traces drive
Go; Go traces go back to the model; either can drive Go again.

**Record then check** (`qtest`).
- `Record(t, binding, scenario)` makes the scenario's goroutine the run's
  (a recorder to memory plus a step log; the global one too with
  `qtest.Global()`), runs the scenario, writes the model-level ITF and
  validates; `Validate` takes steps recorded elsewhere. Either states its
  verdict with `Run.Expect` (`Conforms()`, or a mutant's `Mismatch`...).
- Checkers are cached per binding, so the model is typechecked once per
  test binary.

Costs, measured: the step log costs ~7 µs per step (reflection-based JSON
of a map, synchronous; `FileSink` is buffered), about the same as the OTel
batch path. It avoids the dependency, not the cost. A hand-written encoder
would be the fix if it mattered.

## 7. edgePublish mapping

| Model action | stand-in (`publisher/publish.go`) | real `chdbexporter/publish.go` | observed args | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pushStart(p)` | `begin` (acquire + batch id) | `push`: after `acquire` and `nextBatch` | batch, gen, epoch; payload **not available** | order domain `batch` |
| `writeTable(x, o)` | `insertTable` | `s.Insert(g.ts.insert, …)`, inline in `withConn` | outcome ok/error | ambiguity not visible to the writer |
| `writeParquet(x, o)` | `writeParquet` | `p.writeParquet(s, signal, gen, batch, rb)`, already a function | same | annotatable as is |
| `writeManifest(x, o)` | `commit` | `p.writeObject(s, manifestPath…)`, inline; `writeObject` also writes seals | same | needs an extraction, or `thread:`/statement-level |
| `rotateGen` | `rotate` | `acquire`, `st.cur = g` under `mu.Lock` when `old != nil` | gen | record before the seal goroutine starts |
| `sealGen(gk)` | `seal` | `seal(signal, g)`, already a function | gen, `obs.batches` = `g.batches` | `close()` seals without rotating: emit `rotateGen` first |
| `crash` | inferred | inferred from a `producer_epoch` change | none | |
| consumer actions | none | not in the exporter | none | a separate recorder in the consumer (roadmap) |

**Observable vs abstracted**
- Observed: batch ids, generation ids, epochs, write outcomes (as the writer
  sees them), and the seal's batch count.
- Abstracted: generation ids and payload names (interned); epochs (numbered
  by appearance).
- Not observable by the writer:
  - whether a failed write landed;
  - payload identity across retries. The collector's queue does not expose an
    item id to the exporter. The options are a content hash of the pdata
    (CPU cost), an upstream change to exporterhelper, or dropping payload
    identity, which gives up the retry-duplication properties;
  - the queue itself (the model computes it);
  - the consumer.

**Model/implementation gaps the spike exposed**
- The model rotates on its own. `publish.go` rotates only when a push
  arrives, so an idle generation stays open until `Close`. The model is
  more permissive, which is fine for replay. MBT needed a `Tick` on the
  stand-in.
- `close()` seals the current generation without a rotation. The model can
  only seal rotated generations, so `Close` must be recorded as `rotateGen`
  followed by `sealGen`, which needs `MAX_GEN = observed + 1`.
- Configurations without `store_tables` or Parquet skip writes that the
  model always performs. They need a model flag, or a binding that emits the
  skipped writes as no-ops (neither built).
- The model's `nextBatch` starts at 1 per epoch, as do `publish.go`'s
  per-namespace counters. That coincidence lets batch ids pass through
  uninterned.

**Applying it to the real exporter** (not done, per the brief: no changes to
`chdbexporter`), in about five small edits:
1. Extract `insertTable`, `commitManifest` and `rotate` as functions.
2. Annotate those three and the existing `writeParquet` and `seal`,
   with `thread:env.batch` (no ctx is threaded through `push`).
3. Decide on payload identity.
4. Add `orchestrion.tool.go`.
5. Build the collector with `orchestrion go build`.

The stand-in's binding should then apply unchanged.

## 8. Roadmap

The spike's roadmap is done. What came after is in docs/HISTORY.md; what
is open, in docs/ROADMAP.md.

## 9. After the move: quint-connect parity, Hegel, conversion

### 9.1 `connect` and quint-connect

`connect` follows the Rust crate's model:
- Quint generates traces with `quint run --mbt` (`Run`) or `quint test`
  (`Test`).
- A `Driver` dispatches on the action taken (`Switch`, standing in for the
  `switch!` macro).
- Nondet picks decode into Go types (`Pick[T]`, `OptPick[T]`, through
  `itf.Decode`, the analogue of serde with the `itf` crate).
- A `StateDriver`'s state is compared with the model's after every step,
  `init` included.

Deliberate differences, each removing a quint-connect gotcha:

| quint-connect | connect |
|---|---|
| one driver instance for every trace; `init` must reset it | `newDriver()` per trace |
| `QUINT_SEED`/`QUINT_VERBOSE` read with `option_env!` (compile time) | read at run time, plus `QUINT_MAX_SAMPLES`, `QUINT_MAX_STEPS`, `QUINT_BACKEND`, `QUINT_BIN` |
| traces read in `read_dir` order | sorted by sequence number |
| state diff only at `QUINT_VERBOSE>=1` | the failing field paths, always (`.Balances[bob]: model 16, implementation 17`), plus the step |
| `quint test` traces fail with "Missing mbt::actionTaken" | the same limit, with an error that says why and what to do (`NondetPath`, or `connect.Run`) |
| `--n-traces` = `--max-samples` | same |

`Step.State` is `Config.StatePath` applied to the variables. Module
qualifiers are stripped from variable names (`m::choreo::s` is `s`), and
a first path element that still carries its qualifier is matched too.
`NondetPath` reads the action and its picks from a sum-type variable, as
quint-connect's `Config.nondet` does.

### 9.2 Hegel (`qhegel`)

hegel-go (v0.9.x) runs its engine in-process (libhegel, through purego),
with no Python and no server. Its stateful API discovers `Rule*` and
`Invariant*` methods by reflection. Two directions are useful with a
Quint model.

**Hegel drives, the model judges.**
- Hegel's rules call the implementation with drawn inputs, including
  invalid ones. The implementation, or the rule, records model steps.
- At the end of each case the run is validated through the binding.
- In `Each` mode a rejected run fails the test case, so Hegel's shrinker
  minimises the run against the model. This is the only direction that
  finds code accepting what the model forbids: model-driven tests never
  take a disabled step. `examples/bank`'s SelfTransfer mutant passes
  every model trace and is caught here.

Cost: each validation is a `quint test` process (~0.5–1 s, mostly
start-up), and shrinking runs hundreds of candidates. `CaseChecker`
caches verdicts:
- identical runs, keyed by the instance constants and the steps with
  process and thread ids numbered by first appearance;
- prefixes. If the model rejected run R at its k-th step, any run with
  the same constants and the same first k steps fails the same way. A
  conformance failure at a step, and an invariant violation after it,
  depend only on the steps up to there.

- skipped steps. Steps the binding skips (refused calls, with
  `outcomes: { error: skip }`) become no model call. In a single-process
  run they are left out of the keys, so candidates that differ only in
  refused calls share a verdict.

Prefix reuse is restricted to one actor, with no reconstruction issues
and no domain clocks, where the reconstructed order is the recording
order. On `examples/bank`'s SelfTransfer test, the three together cut
quint runs from ~450 to 53 (about 5 min to 40 s), with the same shrunk
result. Constants are part of the key
because bindings may size them from the whole run (`max "amount"`): a
longer run can have larger bounds, which can enable steps.

`After` mode keeps the distinct runs and validates them in parallel at
the end (`validate.Checker.CheckRuns`, one quint process per run, up to
GOMAXPROCS). We tried batching several runs into one `quint test`, but a
Quint module can import a parameterised module with only one set of
constants unqualified, and bindings size constants per run, so batching
would mean rewriting every template's expressions with instance
qualifiers. Parallel processes are simpler and nearly as fast.

**The model drives, Hegel varies.** `Replay` draws a trace index and
optionally a prefix length, then replays the trace on a driver built
from the Hegel test case. Handlers can draw what the model abstracts:
payloads, timings, interleaved invalid requests that must change
nothing. A failure shrinks toward trace 0, a shorter prefix and simpler
draws.

Not built:
- driving the model live from Hegel rules (checking each rule's
  precondition in Quint). It would need a Quint evaluator in-process, or
  a long-lived quint REPL; the post-hoc check gives the same verdicts at
  the end of each case.
- seeding Hegel from Quint traces (Hegel has no explicit-example API in
  Go yet).

### 9.3 Converting existing telemetry (`convert`)

Not every system can be instrumented with model steps. `convert` maps
an application's ordinary spans to steps:
- span name globs, with `where:` attribute filters, or span events;
- each argument, observation, order key and identity is an expression:
  `attr:K` (looked up on the event, then the span, then the resource),
  `span:`, `resource:`, `event:`, `name`, `trace_id`, `status`, a
  `=literal`, or `|int` to convert.

Converted steps are numbered densely per recorder in time order. Native
`quint.step` events in the same input pass through untouched. What
conversion cannot give:
- **gap detection.** A missing span is invisible: there is no dense
  sequence number from the source;
- **program order beyond time order**, unless a `thread:` expression
  (e.g. `trace_id` for strictly sequential traces) supplies it. Concurrent
  operations within a span's resolution are ordered by end time, which is
  sound only where those operations commute in the model.

The binding is unchanged: the same binding checks recorded and converted
steps (`examples/bank`).

### 9.4 Long replays and quint's error positions

A replay is one `init.then(c1).then(c2)...` chain, and the Rust evaluator
rejects chains nested much past 50 steps ("recursion limit exceeded").
`binding.RenderModule` writes longer chains as named segments of 20 calls
(`action conformsTest_seg0 = c1.then(c2)...`), and the run chains the
segments. Each call stays on its own line, so a failure is still located
by line, with two cases quint reports elsewhere:
- the last call of the whole run evaluating to false is QNT511 ("Test …
  returned false") at the run's own line;
- the last call of a segment evaluating to false is QNT513 at the
  top-level `.then(segK)` line.

Both are mapped to the call. A failed test with no location at all is
quint failing, not the model rejecting the run, and is an error. A
400-step concurrent kvstore run validates in about 7 s.

### 9.5 Bulk checking and the Batched mode

Process start-up and model loading cost a quint process ~0.5 s, which
dominates the replay of a short run. `validate.Checker.CheckBatch` works
like this:
1. It reconstructs and plans every run in Go.
2. It groups the actors' traces by their rendered instance constants.
   Traces of one instance can share a module. Constants may depend on
   the run, so grouping, not a union of constants, keeps every verdict
   the one a lone check would give.
3. It writes one module per group and chunk (tests `r<i>_conformsTest`,
   `r<i>_<inv>InvTest`), runs the chunks in parallel, and maps quint's
   output back to each run.
4. A chunk quint cannot evaluate is re-checked one trace at a time.

24 runs: CheckBatch 1.6 s, CheckRuns (a process per run, in parallel)
6.6 s, one at a time ~14 s.

Hegel needs a verdict for each test case before it moves on, and its
shrinker is sequential, so a failing case cannot wait for a batch.
`qhegel`'s `Batched` mode splits the work instead:
1. **Generate.** `hegel.WithPhases(PhaseGenerate)` and a fixed seed;
   cases are recorded, not checked.
2. **Check in bulk** (`CaseChecker.Prefetch`, which fills the verdict
   cache). If every run passes, start another round with the next seed
   (`Rounds`, `Budget`).
3. **Replay** the failing round with the same seed in `Each` mode. The
   cache decides every case up to the failing one without quint, and
   Hegel shrinks the failure against the model.

If the replay does not meet the failing case (the body was not
deterministic in Hegel's draws), the bulk failure is reported unshrunk.
On a 40-case machine:
- all runs passing: Each 22 s, After 3.3 s, Batched 3.4 s;
- with a bug: Each 32 s (shrunk), After 3.4 s (not shrunk), Batched
  23 s (shrunk, same counterexample).

Batching amortizes start-up over runs that are all new (generation); the
cache reuses verdicts across runs that share prefixes (shrinking).

### 9.6 Distributed systems (`examples/glomers`)

Three things were needed beyond the single-process examples:
- **Cross-process order.** Each node records its steps with itself as
  the thread and a Lamport clock as the domain clock (`order.lamport`);
  the clock rides in message bodies.
  - Reconstruction then orders a delivery after its send, even across
    per-node step logs written by separate processes under real
    Maelstrom.
  - Getting this right needed a fix: steps with equal clock values are
    concurrent, and every one of them must precede every step with a
    larger value. Linking sorted neighbours only left `a(3)` unordered
    with `c(4)` in `a(3) b(3) c(4)`.
- **Linearization points at services.** A KV operation takes effect at
  the service, and the node only hears of it later, after other
  operations may have happened. The simulator's lin-kv records its
  operations itself.
- **Collections as observations.** Gossip carries sets and vectors, and
  reads return them. qobs records slices and maps as JSON text, and the
  binding's `toSet`, `toList` and `toMap` turn them back into Quint
  values.

Long, real runs also needed the replay segments (§9.4) to nest. At 2841
steps, 142 segments chained at the top level were again too deep for
the Rust evaluator, so segments are now grouped into segments
recursively, and no chain is longer than 20.

### 9.7 What a check costs

Measuring a 2841-step Maelstrom log of unique ids (152 s at first) showed
where a replay's time goes:
- **quint's start-up and parse**: ~8 s for a 660 KB generated module;
- **the evaluation itself**: ~5 s;
- **writing the ITF**, the model's full state at every step: 105 MB when
  the state holds every id issued, and as long again to annotate in Go;
- **one more full replay per invariant**: each invariant had its own run
  (for precise attribution), and each wrote its own ITF, which nothing
  read.

Changes:
- **The fused run.** A replay module first holds one run that checks
  each step's expect and every invariant together (`allTest`,
  `binding.FastTests`). It decides a passing run in one replay. Only the
  runs that fail it are replayed again, from a second module
  (`<base>_detail.qnt`, `binding.DetailTests`), whose conformance run and
  per-invariant runs say which check failed and where. Failing runs pay
  a second quint process; passing ones, the common case, save k replays.
- **Optional ITF.** `Options.NoITF` (CLI `-noitf`) skips it, and Hegel's
  checks always skip it, since they only need verdicts.
- **Segment names** no longer contain "Test", so `quint test --match`
  does not take them for tests.

The model matters as much:
- **A history property should not be an invariant that re-scans the
  history.** `issued.keys().forall(i => issued.get(i) == 1)` is
  quadratic over a run. A ghost flag set when a new element repeats an
  old one is constant per step.
- **A model of the mechanism can avoid the history.** Per-incarnation
  counters are state bounded by restarts, not by ids. They are a proof
  of the specification only with a lemma about the encoding, which a
  property test checks (examples/glomers README).

After both: 64 s (19 s without ITF) for the original model, 21 s (11 s)
for the ghost-flag model, 7 s for the scheme model.

Batches of many short runs (explorations, sweeps, Hegel, Linearize's
candidates) cost something else. With `--backend rust`, `quint test`
starts one evaluator per test, one after another, each sent the whole
compiled module as JSON (3.3 MB per test for a module of 40 short runs):
40 tests took 14.6 s, against 4.6 s with the TypeScript backend, which
evaluates them in its own process. CheckBatch therefore replays a chunk
of several traces with TypeScript, unless a backend was chosen
(checkout's, glomers' and streams' short suites: 20-55% faster), and a
single long replay stays on Rust.

Two ways around quint's front end were measured and dropped:
- **A long-lived `quint repl` session per instance**, a replay sent as a
  line per step. Each input costs 10-40 ms: the TypeScript front end
  parses and typechecks it against the whole module, so a 90-step run
  took 0.7 s, slower than in a batch. The verdicts matched.
- **The Rust evaluator directly** (`quint_evaluator test-from-stdin`,
  0.12 s per run): its input is the compiled syntax tree and lookup
  table, and `quint compile --target json` costs as much as the front
  end it would replace (6.6 s for the same 40 runs). Only an IR built in
  Go from the binding's Quint text (a parser and name resolution of our
  own) would avoid it; the evaluator's stdin protocols are internal and
  pinned per quint release.

## 10. Simulated environments and fault injection (`qenv`)

Maelstrom found the bugs no in-process check found in examples/glomers.
Each time, the in-process environment had been more forgiving than its
contract: a "sequentially consistent" store that was in fact
linearizable. `qenv` makes the environment's contract explicit, and
adversarial within it.

**A fault is a choice the contract allows.** A lost response, a
redelivered message, a read from an older snapshot and a crash between
two statements are all behaviours that the network's, the broker's or the
store's contract permits. A double makes exactly those choices and no
others, so a failure is never "the harness did something impossible". The
remaining question, whether a contract is the one production has, is
answered by running against more than one profile (§10.2).

### 10.1 One decision source

Every choice goes through a `Chooser`: which runnable task goes next, whether
a fault happens here, which pending message is delivered, how long a
status lags. The conventions:
- **Option 0 is nominal**: no fault, the oldest message, the first task.
  A shrinker that lowers values toward 0 removes faults and canonicalises
  the schedule.
- **Kinds.** Kinds starting with `fault.` are faults, with per-kind rates
  (`Rates`, matched by prefix). Any other kind is a schedule choice,
  uniform under a seed.
- **Backends.**
  - `qhegel.Choices(tc)` draws entropy in fixed-size byte chunks: a run makes
    hundreds of choices, and a draw per choice made a shrinking test 20x
    slower.
  - `NewSeeded(seed)` gives random runs, Maelstrom- or Jepsen-style.
  - `Replay(choices)` repeats a recorded run, and panics at the first
    divergence.
  - `Nominal` makes no faults.
  - `Swarm` turns whole fault kinds off per run.

### 10.2 Doubles with contract profiles

| Double | Contract | Faults (choices) |
|---|---|---|
| `Store` | transactions at `Serializable` (optimistic validation of reads, scans and writes), `SnapshotIsolation` (first committer wins, write skew allowed) or `ReadCommitted` (latest committed reads, last writer wins); `GetForUpdate` row locks; a crashed process's transactions abort | the interleaving of statements; a commit applied but reported unknown (`store.<name>.commit`) |
| `Queue` | at least once; FIFO only if `Ordered` | lost acknowledgements, redelivery of a crashed consumer's messages, delivery order |
| `Service` (RPC) | at most one response, maybe never | lost or duplicated requests, lost responses (the ambiguous failure) |
| `Process` | tasks die together; no deferred code runs; a restart rebuilds from durable doubles only | crashes at any step (`nemesis`, per step) |
| kubesim (fleetrollout) | generation bumps on spec change; status lags; resourceVersion conflicts | failed requests, applied updates with lost responses, status lag |

Profiles turn "harness quirk or real bug?" into a table. In
examples/checkout, missing row locks are a bug only under read committed,
and a lock without a write only under snapshot isolation. Which row
applies depends on what production runs.

### 10.3 Scheduling

Tasks are goroutines, but only one runs at a time. A task runs until it
reaches a seam (`Yield`, `Wait`, `Sleep`, an operation of a double), where
the scheduler picks the next one. Code between seams is atomic, so a run
is a function of its choices. Virtual time jumps to the next deadline when
nothing can run. `Settle` turns faults off, heals what persists, and runs
the canonical schedule until quiet. Properties conditioned on quiescence
apply after it.

Code under test reaches the environment only through seams: `qenv.DB` and
`Txn`, its own interfaces for brokers and services, `qenv.Go`, `qenv.Now`
and `qenv.Sleep`. Outside a simulation these fall through to real
goroutines and time. Production puts real clients behind the interfaces.

### 10.4 Recording and checking

Steps are recorded where effects happen:
- `Txn.OnCommit` runs at the commit itself, even when the caller is told
  the outcome is unknown. In production, the step goes in a table in the
  same transaction.
- A remote service records its own operations (the payment provider).
- A simulated API server records patches as it applies them.

`qtest.Explore` runs a scenario over many seeds and checks every run in
one `CheckBatch`. `Exploration.Expect` states either that all conform, or
that some failing run shows the expected verdict.
`qhegel.FindViolation` with `qhegel.Choices` shrinks a failure to the
interleaving and faults it needs. In examples/checkout that took 11 quint
checks; the verdict cache answered the other 599 candidates.

### 10.5 The same model in the real environment

examples/fleetrollout runs one controller two ways:
- in kubesim, under `qenv`;
- on three kwok clusters, with real etcd, kube-apiserver and
  kube-controller-manager, and `kill -9` as the fault.

Both write the same steps, judged by one model. The model works on
evidence (reads ordered by resourceVersion), so it is sound wherever the
controller reads fresh from each API server. Both mutants fail in both
environments.

What the real run needs that the simulation does not: a durable step log
(`FileSink`, durable because a killed process loses buffered steps and the
loss at the end of a log is undetectable), and recording at the response
rather than at the server. The API server's audit log would be the
faithful recording point.

### 10.6 Running someone else's controller logic (`examples/crossdb`)

crossdb simulates crossplane-runtime's managed reconciler itself, not a
re-implementation of it. Two things made that work:
- **A manager stub.** The reconciler only needs a manager's client and
  scheme, and the client is the intercepted fake.
- **Clock translation at the seam.** The reconciler stamps annotations
  with `time.Now()` and checks them with `time.Since`. Those calls are
  out of qenv's reach. The kube interceptor stores the timestamps in
  virtual time and returns them in real time (`Sim.ToVirtual`,
  `Sim.ToReal`), so a 30 s grace period lasts 30 s of virtual time.

Without the translation the simulation was wrong in a way that looked
like a finding: deletions never finished. With it, the exploration found
real ones:
- a leak with no crash (an ambiguous create, then a delete);
- a leak when the grace period is disabled (deletion during the cloud's
  read-after-create lag).

The same provider, model and audit then ran on kind with full Crossplane,
with steps from two processes merged by a wall-clock domain clock.

### 10.7 Not yet

- **Contract conformance of the doubles, in both directions.** Every
  `Store` checks each commit's dependency cycles against its level and
  every `Queue` its contract under `GOTOGETHER_CHECK` (§42): what a double
  does is allowed. That everything allowed it can do is still argued by
  the anomaly tests (`TestIsolationAnomalies`), not checked.
- **Machines.** Clocks, disks and partitions are per process (§42); a
  machine grouping processes that share a clock, a disk and a network
  link is not modelled.
- **Steering by coverage.** Fault coverage (`Coverage`, `Exercised`) says
  which choices runs made; exploration does not yet steer toward the
  ones they did not.
- **Go's own scheduler.** Goroutines that bypass `qenv.Go` run
  uncontrolled, and a run that depends on them is not reproducible.
  Replay detects this but cannot prevent it.

## 11. Metastable failures (`qload`, `qmeta`)

A metastable failure leaves no wrong answer to check. The system enters
a degraded state and stays in it after its trigger is gone: a spike
fills a queue, requests time out, and their retries keep the queue full.
No Quint invariant over individual steps says "the system came back".
That is a property of rates over time. Two papers set out how to analyse
it, and this is their pipeline, with each tier checking the next:
- Isaacs et al., "Analyzing Metastable Failures", HotOS '25;
- Alvaro et al., "Formal Analysis of Metastable Failures in Software
  Systems", 2025.

| Tier | Package | Cost | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| CTMC over (queue, orbit) | `qmeta.New`, `HittingTimes`, `Field`/`SVG` | ~0.1–1 s per configuration | where the tipping point is; how policies rank |
| calibration | `qmeta.Calibrate` (simulated trajectories) | seconds | the chain's rates, so its numbers mean something |
| simulation | `qload.Simulate`, `qmeta.Recovers` | ~0.1–0.5 s per run of 20 simulated minutes | does this policy, this code, recover from this trigger |
| trigger search | `qhegel.FindTrigger` (Hegel) | ~1 min | the smallest trigger that breaks it, shrunk |
| the real system | (load tests) | hours | confirms the one trigger the search found |

### 11.1 Recovery as the property

`qmeta.Recovers` takes the papers' definition. Within W after the
stressor ends, goodput is back to at least 90% of what it was before. A
trigger is extra load, a slowdown (a capacity dip in a dependency) and a
duration. All three shrink toward none, so Hegel's result is the smallest
stressor that tips the system. A run's escape from the metastable region
is chance, so each candidate trigger runs several seeds and a majority
decides (`Mostly`). Per-request randomness comes from a seeded
generator, not the Chooser: a run has tens of thousands of requests, and
what the search should vary is the trigger.

### 11.2 The code under test on virtual time

qload runs on qenv. That is what lets the retry library itself sit in the
loop (`ClientConfig.Retrier`), rather than a model of it. The library
receives the virtual time as an argument, and limiters such as
`x/time/rate` already accept one. Clients are open-loop (Poisson
arrivals) or closed-loop (`Population`, `Think`). The difference
decides results. A controller's objects are a closed loop: the workqueue
merges a failing object's poll into its retry. The open-loop version of
the Crossplane provider found storms under crossplane-runtime's defaults
that cannot happen. The closed-loop version found none.

### 11.3 What the tiers taught each other

- **Rejection semantics.** In examples/retrystorm the simulation showed
  that backoff alone recovers worse than immediate retries. An immediate
  retry rejected by a full queue spends its retries at once and gives up,
  which sheds load. A retry after backoff comes back. The first chain
  dropped rejected transitions and predicted the opposite. It now has
  both rules.
- **Truncation.** With the orbit bounded at 60, the chain predicted quick
  recovery for backoff. At 120 it predicted a storm. A finite chain must
  be big enough to hold the storm it is asked about.
- **Absolute times.** The chain's recovery times were orders of magnitude
  above the simulation's (immediate retries at 9.5 req/s from (100, 30):
  minutes simulated against days predicted). It ranks policies and places
  the tipping point; for numbers it must be calibrated.
- **A simulator bug.** A `qenv.Signal` wait that timed out stayed in the
  signal's waiter list, so a later `Notify` cut short the task's next
  wait, a backoff sleep. Requests in the orbit outnumbered the controller's
  objects, which is impossible, and that exposed it. The fix tags each
  wait with its generation (`TestSignalTimeoutIsForgotten`). Checking a
  simulation's own invariants (population ≥ orbit) is cheap. Do it.

### 11.4 Correctness stays with Quint

A mitigation is code. The retry budget's accounting is recorded and
checked against `model/retry.qnt`, whose invariant is the amplification
bound. Its `Uncapped` mutant passed the load tier: after 6000 s of quiet
the overfilled bucket still let 4 of 5 runs recover. The model rejected
its first wrong step. The tiers are complementary: Quint for what each
step does, qmeta and qload for what the rates do.

### 11.5 Not yet

- **Multi-server chains.** The chain has one server. A dependency chain,
  where retries amplify at every hop, needs a product of chains or
  simulation only.
- **Calibration of mitigations.** `Calibrate` fits λ and τ. A budget's
  or backoff's effective parameters could be fitted too.
- **Real-system confirmation.** Run the trigger Hegel found against the
  real provider on kind, with a throttling dbaas server (`dbaas-server
  -throttle-rps`).

### 11.6 The application itself under load (`examples/checkout`)

The tiers above abstract a system into queues and rates. The checkout
saga ran under load as itself: its outbox, consumers, retries and
database, with only the provider given a capacity (`qenv.Capacity`:
workers, a queue, service times from a seeded generator, a slowdown, and
optional shedding of calls whose caller gave up). Goodput was counted
from the shop's own model steps, and the same run was checked against the
model. What that showed, which no abstraction had:
- **The trigger can be noise.** With more consumers than the provider's
  capacity times the timeout, the collapsed state is reachable from
  ordinary variance. Search finds the empty trigger. This is a design
  bound, best stated as one: consumers ≤ capacity × timeout.
- **Retry loops compose.** A retry budget in the shop's provider client
  did nothing, because the broker's redelivery is a second, unbudgeted
  retry loop around it. A budget has to cover every loop, or the
  outermost one has to be bounded.
- **Wasted work is the mechanism.** Shedding calls whose caller gave up
  restored recovery without changing anything else.
- **Load is a fault injector.** With no injected fault at all, the storm's
  timeouts charged orders twice when the idempotency key was missing. With
  crashes, lost responses and redeliveries added, the faithful shop
  conformed through the storm. Correctness and recovery are separate
  checks on the same run.

## 12. What the examples changed in the core

After checkout, fleetrollout, crossdb, retrystorm and checkout-under-load,
the same workarounds kept appearing in examples. They are now in the core.
- **A recorder per run, carried by the context.** `qobs.WithRecorder`
  puts a recorder in a context. `qenv.WithContext` makes it the root of
  every task's context in a simulation (`Sim.Context` outside tasks).
  `qtest.Explore` gives each seed its own recorder and runs seeds in
  parallel, and `qmeta.Runs`, `Count` and `Mostly` run a trigger's seeds
  in parallel. A Hegel test records the same way
  (`qhegel.Case.Context`). The global recorder remains for real
  processes and woven code.

  At first, a step recorded through `context.Background()` inside a
  simulation went to the global recorder and was missing from its run.
  Four call sites did this (`settle` in three examples, a test scenario),
  and the model caught each one at once. That is now impossible rather
  than merely caught. qenv registers which simulation each goroutine
  belongs to: every task's goroutine, and the goroutine that created the
  simulation. qobs consults that registry when a step's context carries
  no recorder (`qobs.SetFallback`). Go has no goroutine-local storage, so
  the goroutine id comes from the stack header, read once per task. It
  cost nothing measurable in the checkout load tests. What remains, a
  step from a goroutine started with `go`, is made loud: Explore and
  Experiment runs are strict (`internal/hooks.Strict`), and such a step panics with
  the fix. It is also caught before running, by `gotogether lint -sim`,
  which flags `go` statements, wall-clock calls and background-context
  steps in files that import qenv, and runs in CI. A compile-time
  guarantee (a context type only qenv can make) was rejected: code under
  test, woven advice and production code all pass a plain
  `context.Context`.
- **Load experiments on the application itself** (`qload.Experiment`).
  Before this, checkout's load harness had its own sampler, step counter,
  recovery windows and arrival process. Now an experiment:
  - deploys the app;
  - drives it open-loop or closed-loop;
  - counts its model steps per tick, so goodput is the rate of a model
    action;
  - samples probes;
  - gives each source of randomness its own seeded stream (`Env.Rand`).

  `qmeta.Assess` and `qmeta.Of` turn an experiment into a recovery
  verdict and into a `System` for `Search`.
- **A recovery verdict that tolerates noise and needs a healthy
  baseline.** Comparing two 100-second windows at a 90% threshold failed
  healthy runs about one time in ten, and `Judge` now allows two standard
  errors. Comparing with the goodput before the trigger hid a real bug:
  with 8 consumers, the checkout shop had collapsed before any trigger,
  and "recovered" to its collapsed rate. An experiment states its healthy
  goodput (`Healthy`), and the verdict uses it.
- **Crashes per virtual second** (`Sim.NemesisEvery`). Load multiplies
  scheduling steps per second, so a per-step crash rate turns into a
  crash storm. Experiments with faults use one crash choice per second.
- **The scheduler checks itself.** `Sim.Check` (or `GOTOGETHER_CHECK=1`)
  verifies, at every step, that:
  - the run queue agrees with the queued flags;
  - no task is both queued and waiting;
  - every timed wait has a live timer;
  - no deadline has passed unserved;
  - time does not go backwards.

  `TestSchedulerSemantics` states the scheduler's semantics as a Hegel
  property over random programs. It fails within a second on the `Signal`
  bug of §11.3, reintroduced. CI runs qenv's tests with the checks on.
- **The store checks its own histories.** Under the same switch, every
  `Store` keeps its committed history (each transaction's versions read,
  scans with their snapshot, and writes) and checks each commit against
  its level in Adya's terms (`qenv/internal/history`): the commit's ww,
  wr and rw dependencies, and the cycle through it with the fewest rw
  edges. No rw edge (G1c) or a dirty read (G1a) breaks every level, one
  (G-single: a lost update, read skew) breaks snapshot isolation, any
  cycle breaks serializability; write skew (two rw edges) is snapshot
  isolation's. TestIsolationAnomalies shows each level's anomalies can
  happen; this shows those it forbids never do. A store with its
  validation turned off is caught at the commit that closes the cycle
  (`TestHistoryCatchesBrokenLevel`), and checkout's, twophase's,
  grpcledger's and streams' runs pass it. A `Queue` checks its contract
  after each operation: every message published and not acknowledged is
  pending or held, none acknowledged is, and an Ordered queue's first
  deliveries wait in publication order. A queue that forgets a crashed
  consumer's messages is caught (`TestQueueContract`), through crashes,
  lost acknowledgements, nacks and partitions.
- **Constants per check** (`qtest.Constants`, in qhegel's `Config.Opts`,
  `validate.Checker.WithConstants`). One binding serves runs of any size.
  Checkout's load runs had needed a copy of the binding with a different
  stock.

Not done, and why:
- **A clock seam for libraries.** Code we write already takes `Sim.Now`.
  The libraries that read the wall clock (crossplane-runtime,
  `x/time/rate` inside client-go's limiters) can't be reached by a seam,
  only by rewriting their calls at build time. That's the same problem as
  scheduling goroutines that bypass `qenv.Go`, and edgepublish (real
  `sync.RWMutex`, a background goroutine) is the place to work on it.
- **A closed-loop chain in qmeta, splitting long runs per key, and one
  vocabulary for performance expectations.** These are useful, but no
  example is blocked on them.

## 13. Code that uses plain Go concurrency (`qenv/weave`)

qenv controls only code that blocks and spawns through it (`qenv.Go`,
`qenv.Sleep`, the doubles). Real code takes `sync` locks and starts
goroutines with `go`. The choices for bringing such code in:
1. **Seams in the source.** The approach so far (checkout, crossdb). It
   is small for code we write, but it changes code that should stay as
   it is.
2. **Rewriting at build time.** This is weaving, and it is what
   `qenv/weave` does.
3. **A patched runtime.** It would cover everything, including the
   standard library, but it ties the toolkit to one Go release.

For a stand-in that must track real code, or for the real code itself,
weaving is the right trade.

**What is woven.** Orchestrion's method-call join point matches calls of
`sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex` and `sync.WaitGroup` methods in the root
module's packages (`package-filter: {root: true}`; never the standard
library or dependencies). Each call becomes a function in `qenv/weave`.
That function asks qenv whether the calling goroutine is a simulation task
(`qenv/internal/keyed.Current`, from the goroutine registry of §12):
- inside a task, it operates on a lock or counter kept by the simulation
  and keyed by the real object's address (`keyed.Lock` and the others).
  Taking the lock is a scheduling point, and waiting for it is a simulated
  wait, with `sync`'s semantics (a waiting writer blocks new readers);
- outside, the real method runs.

**Goroutines.** Orchestrion has no join point for `go` statements. A
directive does reach the statement's function value, so `//qenv:go`
before `go func(){…}()` wraps the literal as `weave.Go(func(){…})`.
`weave.Go` runs in the goroutine executing the go statement, before the
new one starts. That ordering is the trick: in a task it starts a
simulation task running the function, and returns a no-op for the real
goroutine. Outside a simulation it returns the function unchanged.

**What escapes.**
- A method value (`return st.mu.RUnlock`) is not a call.
- An unmarked `go` is not rewritten.
- A call promoted through an embedded lock (`t.Lock()` on
  `struct{ sync.Mutex }`) is not matched, because Orchestrion's
  method-call join point compares the receiver expression's type, not
  the method's. A probe confirmed this, through a nested struct too.

`gotogether lint -weave` reports all three by name, without type information
(it flags the embedding, not each call). The edgepublish stand-in needed
the first two fixes; the lint flags both on the original code.

**Interrupted work.** A crashed task stays frozen while the run goes on
and unwinds at `Close`. A step its deferred code records then
(`//quint:action` records on return) would claim a completion that did
not happen. It goes to `Recorder.Interrupted` instead of the run:
reported with a failing exploration, never checked. Recording on return
describes what the caller saw. An effect the model must see whether or
not its caller survives belongs at the effect's site, recorded by the
double or service, as checkout's store commits and crossdb's cloud
already are. A task that crashes its own process stops in `Crash`; it
used to run on to its next scheduling point.

**What the publisher in a simulation found.**
- The stand-in rotated backwards: a `Tick` waited for the exclusive lock
  past a boundary another push had rotated across. The real exporter had
  fixed this, and the stand-in predated the fix. Hand-written scenarios
  never found it: it needs a read of the clock, a wait for the lock
  through slow writes, and a rotation by someone else in between.
- With the publisher unchanged and in the simulation, the timing
  questions became testable: load turned S3 queueing delay into ambiguous
  writes and duplicate commits.
- qenv had two gaps, found by this example:
  - a background goroutine's `context.Background()` slept in real time;
    qenv now finds the task through the goroutine;
  - a killed task's deferred `//quint:action` recorded a write that never
    completed; such steps are now discarded.

**Not done.**
- `sync.Cond`, `sync.Once` (harmless: it never blocks across simulated
  time unless its function does), channels and `select`. Channels are
  operators, not calls, so Orchestrion cannot match them; they would need
  a rewriter of our own.
- The real exporter, which also needs its chDB sessions behind a seam.

## 14. A whole program in a simulation (gosim, `qgosim`, `examples/gosim`)

§13's third option, a patched runtime, exists:
[gosim](https://github.com/jellevandenhooff/gosim) translates a program and
everything it imports, standard library included, into a module that runs
on its own deterministic runtime. Goroutines, channels, `select`, timers,
maps, `sync`, the network (TCP) and the file system are all simulated, on
several machines that can crash and restart. It is MIT-licensed and
experimental, by one author; the last commit is from December 2024. The
spike asked whether gosim can be the runtime under qenv's choices and
Quint's checks, for code that qenv's seams and weaving do not reach.

**Go 1.26.** gosim works by replacing, at translation time, every
standard-library function that talks to the Go runtime (a body-less
function, an assembly routine, a `linkname`) with a hook. The hook tables
were written for Go 1.23, so 1.24 and 1.26 both fail on the first missing
hook. A translator change reports every missing hook in one run, not one
per run. That list for 1.26 was about 40 entries:
- `sync.Mutex`, moved to `internal/sync`;
- `sync.Map`, now a hash trie that takes the runtime's hasher from a map
  type descriptor (that map stays a real map);
- weak pointers (kept strong) and synctest (unsupported in a simulation);
- `vgetrandom`, which falls back to the simulated system call;
- three compiler intrinsics that panic when they are not intrinsified,
  once translated to another package path.

Other translator fixes:
- FIPS 140 crypto: its assembly reads package variables that translation
  moves into per-machine globals, so translation builds with `purego`;
- hooks matched methods of the same name;
- `~map[K]V` constraints did not admit named map types;
- reflect gained `TypeAssert` and `Seq`;
- the file system had to accept `O_DIRECTORY`.

gosim's behaviour suite passes on 1.26.1. Its race mode does not build
yet (`internal/race` changed), and is not needed here.

**The Chooser.** All of gosim's nondeterminism comes from one seeded
generator in its scheduler. That makes it one seam:
- every bounded pick goes through `gosimruntime.Choose(kind, n)`: the next
  goroutine ("sched"), a ready `select` case ("select"), where a map
  iteration starts ("map"), and whatever the program asks for
  (`fault.partition` in the example);
- unbounded randomness (math/rand, crypto/rand, hash seeds) comes from a
  generator seeded by one choice.

Option 0 is nominal: the first runnable goroutine, the first ready case,
no fault. That is qenv's convention, and it makes Hegel shrink toward the
canonical schedule. A qenv `Chooser` is a gosim `Chooser`. With qenv's
`Recorder` and `Replay`, a run of 5500 choices replays to the identical
step sequence, and `Replay`'s divergence check holds.

**Hegel stays outside.** Translation covers every import, and Hegel calls
a native library, so Hegel cannot run in the simulation. The test is in
two halves:
- the simulated half is an ordinary gosim test (`//go:build sim`);
- a normal `go test` in the host drives it over gosim's metatest protocol
  (the test binary on a pipe). The fork extends that protocol: during a
  run, the binary asks the host for each choice and sends it each line
  the program `Emit`s, here the qobs step log. On the host,
  `metatesting.MetaT.RunWith` serves a qenv `Chooser`.

A Hegel abort is a panic from inside `Choose`. It stops the binary, and
the next run starts a fresh one. `qhegel.Case.Add` takes the
emitted steps, so `FindViolation` judges and shrinks gosim runs as it
does qenv's.

**What it ran.** The Glomers broadcast node, unchanged, on three machines
over real TCP, with a client and a nemesis that isolates nodes on chosen
steps. The runs conform to the broadcast model. The ReadOwnOnly mutant
fails at a read. Hegel found NoRetry's lost value and shrank it to two
gossips lost to an isolated node, with the rest of the schedule nominal.
Code in the run, none of it written for the simulation:
- the node and its Maelstrom runtime, `net`, `bufio`, `encoding/json`,
  tickers and mutexes;
- qobs and the OTel API it imports.

One harness change: the runtime got `Node.Start` (a transport other
than stdio) and `Barrier` (the Lamport barrier behind `Sim.Step`). Its
Hegel network driver is excluded from `sim` builds.

**Costs.**
- A choice round trip to the host is about 50 µs. A cluster run takes
  350 ms with qenv choosing and 60 ms on gosim's own seed. Eight in ten
  choices are the scheduler's. Handing the simulation entropy in chunks,
  as `qhegel.Choices` already draws it, would remove most of the round
  trips. Fault choices would still go to the host one by one, for their
  rates and notes.
- The first build translates the standard library and every dependency,
  about a minute. It is cached after that.
- The fork is about 600 lines. The upstream project is quiet, so
  carrying the patch is the realistic plan; most of it is the version
  port, which upstream would need anyway.

**Compared with qenv and weaving.** gosim covers what qenv reaches only
through seams, and what weaving cannot rewrite:
- channels and `select`;
- the standard library's own goroutines and timers;
- dependencies;
- the network and the disk.

In exchange:
- the code under test runs in a translated copy;
- the Go version is pinned to the hooks;
- doubles with contract profiles (isolation levels, lossy RPC) and
  qload's open- and closed-loop clients still belong to qenv.

The two fit together. The simulated program asks `Choose` for its faults
under qenv's names, and the same Chooser, Hegel included, drives either
runtime.

**Not done.**
- Machine crashes (`Machine.Crash`, restart). The broadcast model has
  no restart.
- Chunked entropy.
- Race mode on 1.26.

A machine that crashes stops without running deferred code, so §13's
interrupted steps cannot arise. A step is sent to the host when it is
recorded.

## 15. Where gosim and a weaver of our own take the toolkit

§14 showed that gosim can run a whole program with every choice made by
qenv's Chooser. This section is the plan that follows from it:
- rebase qenv onto runtimes, so that the same deployment runs on qenv's
  scheduler or on gosim;
- turn gosim's translator into a weaver of our own;
- use the weaver's annotations to tie simulation, load, the CTMC and
  production telemetry together.

### 15.1 One deployment, several runtimes

qenv is two things in one package:
- a scheduler: tasks, virtual time, signals, processes, choices;
- doubles written against it: `Store` with its isolation profiles,
  `Queue`, lossy `Service` calls, kubesim.

The doubles reach the scheduler through a narrow seam:
- the context-level functions (`qenv.Go`, `Now`, `Sleep`, `Wait`,
  `WaitFor`, `Signal`);
- `Process`, for crashes;
- `Choose` and `Fault`.

Put that seam behind an interface, a runtime, with three
implementations:

| runtime | tasks, time, waits | processes | choices | for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| qenv's scheduler (today) | simulated tasks, virtual time | frozen tasks, `OnCrash` | the Chooser | exploration, Hegel, load: a run in milliseconds |
| native, in gosim | `go`, `time`, channels: simulated by gosim | gosim machines (`Machine.Crash`, `Restart`) | `gosimruntime.Choose`, so the same Chooser on the host | fidelity: the standard library, dependencies, the network |
| native, on the wall clock | the same code, unsimulated | OS processes, or none | a seeded or random chooser | soak tests and demos against real time |

The native runtime is plain Go, so it belongs in core. gosim contributes
only two things, the choice function and machines, through two hooks
that the gosim adapter installs from a `sim` build. Core never imports
gosim.

A deployment written once (checkout's `Deploy`, crossdb's cloud,
fleetrollout's API servers) then runs on all three runtimes, with the
same model and binding:
- on gosim, crossdb's clock translation (`ToVirtual`, `ToReal`) is
  unnecessary, because crossplane-runtime's own `time.Now` is virtual;
- fleetrollout's interceptors can become real HTTP between machines.

The predicate `Wait` is the one operation without a native counterpart.
The doubles that use it (the queue, call results, keyed locks) should move
to `Signal`, which maps onto a channel. `Wait` stays, polling on the
native runtimes.

What does not move:
- qenv's scheduler: Hegel and qload need its speed;
- the doubles' contract profiles, because a real database rarely shows
  write skew on demand;
- trace validation of real environments.

### 15.2 A weaver of our own

gosim's translator already does the hard part of a weaver. It loads the
whole program with types (`go/packages`), rewrites it with `dst` and
keeps the comments. It rewrites more than Orchestrion can:
- channels and `select`;
- `go` statements;
- the standard library and dependencies.

Factor it into a pass framework with two front ends:
- **translation**, for gosim: the passes run before gosim's own;
- **`-toolexec`**, for ordinary builds, as Orchestrion does: each
  package is rewritten on its way to the compiler, so the same aspects
  reach production binaries.

Orchestrion parity is the floor:
- **join points:** function declarations (by name, signature,
  receiver, directive), calls, struct literals, imports and directives;
- **advice:** wrap an expression, prepend or append statements, inject
  declarations, add a struct field, replace a body;
- **aspect files:** read Orchestrion's YAML format, so its existing
  integrations (net/http, database/sql, gRPC) are available.

Types make our weaver better than parity where Orchestrion's matching
is syntactic, which caused the escapes §13 lists:
- method values (`return mu.RUnlock`) are woven: bind the receiver
  when the value is made;
- promoted calls through an embedded `sync.Mutex` are matched by the
  method's own type;
- calls through an interface get a dynamic check;
- channel sends, receives and `select` become join points, so
  `qenv/weave` covers channels on qenv's fast runtime, the case §13
  left undone.

Then `gotogether lint -weave` has nothing left to report.

The weaver lives in its own module, with gosim's translator, because it
depends on `dst` and `x/tools`; core stays light. The fork needs a home
of its own first (§15.5).

### 15.3 Annotations that serve the model, the load model and production

Today one annotation, `//quint:action`, makes a function a model step.
With a weaver in both front ends, every annotation means one thing in
production and one in a simulation, from the same source.

**Actions (exists, extended).**
- `//quint:action` records on return, as now. It can also record a
  `begin` at entry, which makes an interrupted action explicit. A crash
  between the two leaves a started, never completed action. The model
  can take that as a possible effect, instead of the step being
  discarded (§13).
- Every action is also a metric: a counter by action and outcome, and a
  latency histogram, under the OTel names that qload's `Series` already
  uses (`writeManifest/ok`). A goodput assertion in a load test and a
  dashboard in production then read the same numbers.

**Load roles.** Two annotations give the CTMC its parameters:
- `//quint:serve name:checkout` on a handler, or on a worker's loop, is
  the server side of `qload`'s model;
- `//quint:call service:payments` on a call site is the client side.

The weaver instruments them to measure the quantities `qmeta.Params`
needs, live:
- the arrival rate and the service rate;
- the concurrency (the CTMC's `u`);
- the timeouts;
- retries in flight, the orbit, the CTMC's `v`. No dashboard has `v`
  today, and it is what tells a slow system from a metastable one.

`qmeta.Calibrate` fits the chain to the trajectories from simulated runs.
The same fit works from production's.

**Alarms from the chain.** `qmeta` computes, for every state `(u, v)`,
the expected time to return to the healthy set (`HittingTimes`).
- The states whose time exceeds a bound form the region a system does
  not come back from by itself. Its boundary in `(u, v)` is an alert
  threshold with a derivation, not a guess.
- The smallest trigger that crosses it (`FindTrigger`) is the headroom
  to report: how big a spike, how long a dip.
- The healthy baseline (`Experiment.Healthy`) and `Recovery.Judge`'s
  tolerance give the normal band.

All of these can be generated as alerting rules over the woven metrics.
They should come with the policy they assume, so a change to the retry
budget in code shows up as a changed alert.

**Faults.**
- `//quint:fault kind:rpc.loss` on a call site is a fault point.
- In a simulation, the weaver wraps it in
  `Choose("fault.rpc.loss", n)`, injecting an error of the call's own
  result type. Option 0 is no fault, so shrinking removes the fault.
- In production it compiles to nothing, or to an opt-in chaos hook.
- Either way it is a list: a run can report which fault points it
  exercised and which it never reached. That is coverage of faults, not
  lines.

Fault points also give `connect` a way to drive a whole program. A Quint
trace's crash and partition actions answer the fault choices, through a
Chooser built from the trace, while the schedule stays nominal.

**Context and ordering.**
- The weaver can propagate model identity across RPCs as OTel baggage
  (`//quint:actor` on a type): actor, process, payload ids.
- It can propagate Lamport clocks, stamping on send and merging on
  receive, as the Maelstrom runtime does by hand.
- Distributed step logs then merge without per-protocol plumbing.
- Deadline propagation, the mitigation checkout's load tests showed to
  recover, can be inserted and its remaining budget recorded on every
  call.

**From the model to the code.**
- The weaver knows every annotated site, so it can list the model's
  actions that have none, and annotated sites that name actions the
  model lacks. That is the binding lint, from the code side.
- The model's actions with weights become `qload`'s workload, the
  model's types its argument generators.

### 15.4 The loop this closes

1. The Quint model fixes what may happen. Annotations put its actions,
   load roles and fault points on the code.
2. qenv's runtime explores the code fast under faults, Hegel shrinks
   the failures, and the CTMC ranks the policies.
3. gosim runs the same deployment, the standard library and network
   included, to confirm what qenv found. A shrunk trigger replays there.
4. Production runs the same annotations as telemetry. Its steps are
   checked against the model, its metrics fit the chain, and its alerts
   come from the chain's recovery region.
5. A production trigger the chain did not predict, or a step the model
   rejects, is a new test, back at step 2.

### 15.5 Phases

| phase | work | depends on |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | the fork in a repository of its own, with CI; choices in chunks from the host (§14's cost) (done, §15.7: a branch for now) | a repository |
| 1 | the runtime interface, the native runtime and the gosim adapter; checkout's tests on qenv and on gosim (done, §15.6) | — |
| 2 | the pass framework in the translator; `//quint:action` as a pass, so the edgepublish publisher runs in gosim without Orchestrion (done, §15.8) | 0 |
| 3 | the `-toolexec` front end; Orchestrion aspect files; method values, promoted calls and channels woven (done as an overlay front end, §15.9; channels left to gosim) | 2 |
| 4 | load roles and action metrics; calibration from production; alerting rules from the chain | 3 |
| 5 | fault points and fault coverage; a Quint trace as a Chooser | 2 |

### 15.6 Phase 1 as built

The runtime interface became a second scheduler inside `*Sim`, not a new
type. `qenv.NewNative(c, platform)` returns the same `Sim`, and every
double, process and example runs on it unchanged:
- **One task at a time.** The running task holds a lock and gives it up
  at seams: Yield, Sleep and waits. A condition variable is broadcast
  when it does, and that serves both predicate waits and Signals. The
  predicate `Wait` therefore stays as it is; the move to `Signal` that
  §15.1 expected was not needed.
- **Processes.** With a Platform, each process runs on a gosim machine.
  The tasks a process is handed (a service's handler, called from
  another process) start there, from a spawn queue that the machine's
  main goroutine serves. A crash stops all of them at once.
- **Crash order.** The crash is requested before the crash hooks run,
  because a hook may restart the process. A process that crashes itself
  has its machine stopped by the platform's goroutine on another
  machine, in order with the restart; gosim cannot stop the machine its
  caller runs on.
- **Settle.** It turns fault choices nominal. It cannot make gosim's
  schedule canonical.
- **Hegel stays out of the simulated packages.** The Hegel adapters
  moved out of the packages a simulation runs, into qhegel:
  `qhegel.Choices` (once `qenv.Hegel`), `FindTrigger` and
  `SearchTrigger` (once in qmeta). The Glomers network driver moved to
  `maelstrom/hegelnet`. Build tags had hidden the dependency instead,
  and the first gosim translation found each one late.
  `internal/simdeps` now fails, in ordinary CI, when a simulated package
  depends on Hegel, purego or cgo, and it prints the import chain.

`qgosim` is the adapter, in a module of its own:
- on the simulated side, `New` (the native runtime with gosim's choices,
  machines and a sink to the host);
- on the host, `Run` and `Scenario`, which give `qtest.Explore` a pool of
  test binaries so that seeds run in parallel.

checkout's tests on gosim reuse the qenv tests' model, binding and
expectations. The faithful shop conforms at every isolation level
through machine crashes, and the write skew is caught. NoIdempotencyKey
shows a second symptom that gosim's schedules reach first:
- the cancellation's void looks the charge up by the order's key;
- the mutant stored the charge under a per-attempt key, so the void
  finds nothing;
- the order stays paid and cancelled, and `settledCorrectly` fails.

On qenv's scheduler the double charge shows first. Both are this bug's,
and the test now names both.

A checkout run makes about 27,000 choices, nine in ten of them the
scheduler's. At 2.7 s a run on gosim against milliseconds on qenv's
scheduler, phase 0's chunked choices are the next thing to do.

### 15.7 Phase 0 as built

**Where the fork lives.** The fork is its own repository and module,
github.com/chucklehead-dev/gosim (it was first a `gosim-fork` branch of
this one, fetched by a script at a pinned commit). It is upstream's
history plus our commits, and its FORK.md says what they change. Keeping
upstream's history makes our changes ordinary commits, which rebase onto
a newer gosim; the module path is one scripted commit on top. qgosim
requires it like any module, at the commit it was built against.

**Entropy.** A chooser that implements `qenv.Entropy` hands out bytes.
`qenv.EntropyOf` finds that capability through `WithContext`,
`Recorder` and `Replay`. The test binary then makes every choice but
faults from 512-byte chunks, by the same rule as `qhegel.Choices`: a
byte, two above 256 options, modulo n.
- Faults still go to the host one by one, for their rates and their
  notes on the test case.
- A Recorder stores each chunk as a choice of kind `entropy`, so a run
  replays exactly.

The effect on broadcast's TCP cluster:

| how choices are made | time per run |
|---|---|
| one round trip per choice | 438 ms |
| gosim's own seed | 60 ms |
| chunks of entropy | 48 ms |

For Hegel, the chunks are the same draws its chooser makes on qenv's
scheduler, so shrinking a gosim run behaves as shrinking a qenv run does.

### 15.8 Phase 2 as built

**The translator reads Orchestrion's own aspect files.** It applies the
aspects of the packages the module's tool file names (`gosim.tool.go`,
else `orchestrion.tool.go`). `//quint:action` is therefore woven from the
same `qobs/orchestrion.yml` that `orchestrion go build` uses: there is no
second definition to drift from it.
- **Where weaving happens.** The fork's `weave` package works at the
  source level, before gosim's own rewrites. Woven files go to every
  `go/packages` load as an overlay, so types, imports and the
  dependency graph see the woven code. `//line` directives keep positions
  on the original lines, and the aspects are part of the translation
  cache's key.
- **What is supported.** Function-body join points with a directive, and
  prepend-statements advice, with `.Function.ArgumentOfType`,
  `.ResultOfType` and `.DirectiveArgs`. Unnamed results the advice needs
  are named, as Orchestrion names them.
- **Imports.** An import the advice needs that the file already has
  under another name reuses that name. gosim's translator gives all
  imports of a path one name, so a second import of qobs, as
  `quintqobs`, failed to compile.

**The publisher on gosim.** The edgepublish publisher runs unchanged
and with no qenv/weave:
- its `sync.RWMutex`, its `WaitGroup` and its background seal goroutine
  are gosim's;
- the seal records through `context.Background()`, so qgosim installs
  the run's recorder as qobs's global on every machine.

It passes the same checks as the woven qenv runs: explored runs conform,
and ManifestBeforeTable and NoRotationLock are caught. NoRotationLock is
caught in 29 of 30 runs. gosim's schedules interleave its unlocked
rotation with pushes far more often than qenv's woven locks do.

**The native runtime became cooperative.** With a Platform, it takes no
lock across the code under test. Three failures led there:
- **A lost mutex.** A `sync.Mutex` in starvation mode is handed to its
  next waiter. When that waiter's machine crashed, the mutex stayed
  locked, and Settle never returned.
- **A forgotten waiter.** A broadcast looping over channel sends
  switches goroutines at every send. A waiter that woke and re-registered
  in between was forgotten, and two paid orders never shipped. Waits are
  now a `sync.Cond` with no lock, whose `Broadcast` is one step of
  gosim's runtime.
- **Mismatched clocks.** A `time.Time`'s monotonic reading is relative
  to a per-machine global under gosim, so deadlines passed between
  machines compared wrongly. The native clock now drops the monotonic
  reading.

### 15.9 Phase 3 as built

**An overlay, not `-toolexec`.** The go command already takes
`-overlay`: a map from source files to the files that replace them. It
computes the build, imports included, from the replacements. So woven
code that imports qobs or qenv/weave, which the original did not, builds
and links with nothing else to do. Orchestrion gets this from
`-toolexec`, by editing each compile's import configuration and building
what is missing. `qweave go test ./...` weaves the module's package
graph, writes the woven files and the overlay, and runs the go command
with it. gosim takes the same overlay through `GOSIM_OVERLAY`. The fork's
own weaver was removed, so qweave is the only weaving engine, and the
fork's change is generic: any tool's overlay.

**qweave** lives in a module of its own, because it needs `x/tools`.
- It reads Orchestrion's aspect files, from the packages a tool file
  imports.
- It supports what our aspects use:
  - join points: `function-body`, `method-call`, `function-call`,
    `function`, `directive`, `package-filter: root`, and the
    combinators;
  - advice: `prepend-statements` and `wrap-expression`, with
    Orchestrion's template data.
- It weaves on typed packages and edits the original text. Nested
  matches compose: each template is rendered from the woven text of the
  spans inside it.

**What types add.** Orchestrion matches syntax. qweave matches types,
so it weaves what Orchestrion missed in §13:
- **method values.** `return s.mu.RUnlock` becomes a literal that binds
  the receiver when the value is made, then makes the advised call;
- **promoted calls.** A call through an embedded `sync.Mutex` is advised
  on the field, `(c).Mutex`.

A fixture uses all three escapes Orchestrion misses: an embedded lock, a
method-value unlock and a `//qenv:go` goroutine. Woven, it runs in a
qenv simulation in 16 ms. Unwoven, it hangs the scheduler.
edgepublish's woven tests (sim, mbt and scenarios) pass under qweave as
under Orchestrion. CI now runs the simulation with qweave, and mbt and
scenarios with Orchestrion, to check compatibility.

**Channels were not woven.** gosim simulates channels and `select`
natively. On qenv's scheduler, a simulated channel would need `select`
over simulated and real channels, and the runtime's own channels such as
`ctx.Done()` and timers. Code with channels belongs on gosim, which
phase 1 made a runtime for the same deployment.

**Found on the way.** A woven goroutine that captured another task's
context slept and waited as that task, and lost increments. Code in a
woven goroutine must record and sleep through `context.Background()`,
which qenv resolves to the goroutine's own task. The skill says so.


### 15.10 Phase 4 as built

**Load roles (`qrole`).** Three annotations, woven by qrole's aspect
file (`//quint:serve name:N`, `//quint:operation service:S`,
`//quint:call service:S`), or the calls they weave (`Serve`, `Operation`,
`Call`), each returning a function that takes the outcome:
- u is a server's requests from arrival to response, waiting included
  (`Roles.Queue`);
- v, the orbit, is the operations in progress with no attempt in flight:
  operations minus calls (`Roles.Orbit`). It needs no knowledge of the
  retry policy, which is why the client side is two annotations;
- `Roles.Instrument` exports them as OTel gauges, with counters of
  requests and attempts by outcome. A simulated run gets a registry of
  its own through its context (`WithRoles`), as with recorders.

**Action metrics.** `qrole.MetricsSink` counts steps by action and outcome
(`quint.steps`) and passes them on. Every `//quint:action` becomes a rate
and an error ratio, counted as the model counts steps. Latency was left
out: a step has one timestamp, at its effect.

**Calibration from observations.** `qmeta.Trajectories` turns a series of
sampled (u, v) into Calibrate's trajectories: from each sample, the
states some seconds later, averaged per cell of the state grid. Any
series works, a qload run's probes or a production scrape.
- A series taken mostly in a storm cannot tell a higher arrival rate
  from a shorter timeout. The fit took λ to μ and above, where nothing
  recovers. `CalibrateTimeout` holds λ, which a running system measures
  (its rate of new operations), and fits the timeout.
- Loss evaluated each trajectory with its own transient analysis, 12,000
  states each time, and a calibration from one run's cells had not
  finished after several minutes. Expectation is linear, so one backward pass
  (`MeanAll`) gives the expectation from every state at once. The same
  calibration takes 5 seconds.

**Alerts from the chain.** `Chain.Region(healthy, bound)` is the set of
states the system is more likely than not still unhealthy from after
`bound` seconds (`RecoveryWithin`: one more backward pass, with healthy
states absorbing).
- The first version used the expected hitting time, and alerted at
  (13, 0) at λ = 9, μ = 10: a state that drains in about a second. Near
  a storm, the mean is dominated by the rare run that tips into it and
  stays for hours. So the probability defines the region, and the mean is
  still reported (`Region.Recovery`).
- `Region.Rules` writes a Prometheus rule group over qrole's metric
  names: one term per band of u, `u in [lo, hi) and v >= vmin`, coarsened
  to bands of `Step` (10) that each take their largest vmin, so the rule
  fires only inside the region. The chain's parameters, the healthy set
  and the bound go into the annotations, so a policy change in code is a
  diff in the rule.

**The example (`examples/retrystorm/alerts.go`).** A server and a
retrying client, instrumented with qrole, run under a spike in a qload
experiment that probes u and v. The chain is calibrated on the run, its
region taken at two minutes, and the alert checked against the run.
- With backoff alone it holds for the whole last minute of the storm
  (u = 100, v = 143).
- With a retry budget the chain has no region: the rule cannot fire, and
  the run has recovered.
- Without a spike it never fires.

### 15.11 Phase 5 as built

**Fault points.** `qenv.FaultPoint(ctx, kind, crash, errs...)` is a fault
choice `fault.<kind>` at a point in the code under test.
- Its options are nominal, then each error in order, then, with crash
  and inside a process, the crash of the calling task's process. The
  process is restarted by a task outside it, as the nemesis restarts
  one. Outside a simulation it returns nil.
- `//quint:fault kind:K error:E... crash:true` weaves it at a function's
  entry (`qenv/fault`'s aspect). An injected error returns through the
  function's named results, which weaving names if they are not. So the
  error is the package's own, typed as the code expects, not a generic
  one. A function without an error result can only crash.
- The same aspect declares the point at init, with a second advice on
  the same join point: Orchestrion's `inject-declarations`, which qweave
  now supports, together with several advice per aspect and
  `.Function.Name`. Written to Orchestrion's schema, checked with qweave
  only.

**Coverage from choices.** A run's recorded choices already hold every
fault choice it reached and the option taken. So coverage needs nothing
from the simulation:
- `qenv.CoverageOf(runs)` and `qtest.Exploration.Coverage()` count per
  kind, declared points and doubles' kinds alike, the runs that reached
  it, the times reached and each option taken;
- `Unreached` lists the declared points no run reached, and `Unfaulted`
  those reached but never faulted.

**A Quint trace as a Chooser.** `qenv.Script` makes exactly the faults it
is given, in order, and no others. Each waits for the steps before it in
the trace (`Progress`, the run's recorded steps). The schedule is
nominal, or a base chooser's.
- `connect.FaultScript(trace, FaultMap)` reads one from a trace: each
  mapped action is a fault kind and option, or a crash
  (`nemesis.crash.<process>`).
- The trace then drives a whole program through its environment, not
  through a driver: the program makes every other step itself, and its
  recorded run is checked against the model.
- A nemesis is chosen by index among the enabled ones, which a trace
  cannot name. The scheduler now asks a chooser that implements
  `ChooseNemesis(names)` by name, through the package's wrappers, and a
  Recorder still records the choice.

`connect/testdata/journal.qnt` is a writer whose writes fail and which
restarts once:
- under each of 8 traces, the program, which knows nothing of traces,
  takes the trace's actions, failed writes and restart included, and
  conforms;
- the mutant that keeps its count in memory follows the same traces, and
  the model rejects its restart (`Mismatch("restart")`).

## 16. Covering arrays (`qsweep`, `qtest.System.Sweep`)

Explorations sample the schedule and the faults. Configurations were a
product written by hand: checkout's isolation levels × mutants, three
sizes × three levels, and so on. Most failures need only a few factors to
interact, so rows in which every pair of factor values appears find what
the product would, at a fraction of its runs (Kuhn et al.; Microsoft's
PICT).

**Generation.** `qsweep.Cover` enumerates the allowed rows of the space
and picks, greedily, the row covering most uncovered t-way tuples, until
none is left.
- A constraint is a Go function of a whole row, and tuples that only
  ruled-out rows contain are not required. That is the hard part of
  PICT's constraint language, for free.
- It finds 9 rows for four 3-valued factors pairwise (the optimum) and 33
  for three-way (27 is optimal).
- The space is bounded (`MaxSpace`, 2M rows), far above what a test
  sweeps.

**Sweeps.** `System.Sweep` explores each row as a subtest, with
per-row options (the model's constants for the row's sizes) and per-row
expectations.
- Fault kinds are factors (`qsweep.Bool`), turned off with `qenv.Without`.
  Swarm testing chooses them at random. A covering array guarantees that
  every pair of kinds runs together, and that each runs without the
  others masking it.
- `Without` and `Swarm` had to keep the run's context outermost: `New`
  finds it only on the chooser it is given.

**Pair coverage.** `qenv.Coverage` now keeps each run's faulted kinds in
the order of their first fault:
- `Pairs` counts, for each two kinds, the runs that faulted both and in
  each order;
- `Untried` lists the pairs never together;
- `OneWay` lists the pairs seen in one order only.
Checkout's random exploration (60 seeds) had every pair together and six
in one order only.

**Orders.** A `qenv.Script` per ordered pair imposes both orders, on a
seeded schedule. All 30 orders of checkout's six kinds happen, and every
run conforms.
- A sequence covering array (`qsweep.Sequences`: every order of t events
  as a subsequence of few sequences) did not fit checkout. A Script
  imposes its faults strictly in turn, and the API's faults happen only
  while orders are placed, so a sequence of all six never completes.
- Sequences suit events that recur through a run, such as crashes and
  partitions.

**What the checkout sweep found.**
- The faithful shop conforms on all 13 pairwise rows of the 432
  combinations of isolation × orders × stock × crashes × three fault
  families (260 runs).
- `NoIdempotencyKey` captures with a fresh key on every attempt, and it
  is two bugs:
  - a cancellation's void cannot find the charge, in every row, with or
    without faults;
  - a double charge, which needs lost provider responses: some run of
    every row with them charges twice, and no run of a row without them
    does.

  The mutants table expected only the second. `Expect(Violates(x))`
  passes on the first run violating x, so the first bug never showed
  there. The README did name both.
- Rows with other stocks than the binding's failed every run until the
  sweep passed the model the row's `STOCK`: sizes are factors of the
  model too.

## 17. Code coverage by model step (`qcover`, `qweave -cover`, `qrun`)

The fault coverage of §15.11 says which faults runs tried. This says which
code they ran, step by step, so coverage can be read against the model
(docs/HISTORY.md, A1).

**Why weave, not Go's `-cover`.**
- Go's counters are global to the process: runs in parallel (Explore's
  seeds) would mix.
- Reading them mid-run means parsing an internal file format.
- qweave already rewrites the code under test, so it inserts the
  counters itself. `qweave -cover` puts a call of `qcover.Hit(id)` at the
  start of every straight-line run of statements, splitting after
  compound or branching statements as cmd/cover does, on the line it
  starts so positions do not move. Each file registers its blocks in a
  package variable.
- Only the main module is instrumented, and never the toolkit's own
  packages, its examples aside: qcover would count itself, and qenv's
  scheduler is not code under test. `-coverpkg` narrows it further.

**Attribution.** A block finds its run's `Counts` and its task through the
goroutine.
- The blocks a task runs between two of its steps are its next step's,
  because steps are recorded where they take effect, at the end of the
  code that made them.
- Blocks are attributed per task, not per stretch of time, so an
  interleaved task's code never lands in another task's step. Two tasks
  interleaving at every step, in four parallel runs, pass under `-race`.
- Code that causes a step in another task is "run, but by no step of the
  task that ran it". That covers a client whose step the service records,
  a relay, setup, and code after a task's last step: the report lists it
  by function.

**The report** (`Evidence().Code`, a `qcover.Summary`):
- statements covered;
- blocks never run, by function;
- code run by no step;
- the blocks each action and outcome ran;
- outcomes of one action that ran the same code: the model tells them
  apart, and these runs' code does not.

On checkout under exploration, 30 seeds cover 76.8% of the shop's
statements. The fixture (qweave/testdata/cover) shows each category: a
fault branch is put/error's alone, a get records both outcomes from the
same code, Compact never runs, and setup and Close run under no step.

**One lookup of a run's state (`qrun`).** qcover needed what qobs and qrole
already had, in different shapes: a value carried by the run's context,
found from the goroutine when the context carries none.
- qrole had no goroutine fallback. Its woven calls in a function with no
  context passed `context.TODO()` and counted into `qrole.Default`,
  shared by runs in parallel.
- `qrun.Key[T]`, `qrun.Get` (the context, then the goroutine's run: a
  task's context, or the simulation's for the goroutine that created it)
  and one resolver installed by qenv now serve all three.
- Every task's context names its task (`internal/runkeys.Task`), for state kept per
  task.
- `qobs.SetFallback` is gone.

**Found on the way.**
- A switch's or select's body is a block of clauses, not statements. A
  coverage call before `case` does not compile; the clauses are
  instrumented, not the body.
- An insertion at the offset where an aspect replaces an expression
  (`mu.Lock()` woven by qenv/weave at the start of a block) must go
  before the replacement, not inside it. qweave orders an insertion
  first among the edits that start at its offset; the sync fixture runs
  woven with `-cover` too.
- A test binary's generated main is in the build cache, outside the
  module: it is not instrumented.

## 18. Claims over runs (`qtest.Some`, `All`, `None`)

`Exploration.Expect` meant two things:
- with `Conforms()`, that every run conforms, recognised by comparing its
  description string;
- with anything else, that one failing run meets all the expectations.

So `Expect(Violates("a"), Violates("b"))` wanted a single run showing
both. Nothing could say "no run of this row double-charges". The
checkout sweep walked reports by hand for it, and the mutants table's
first-match semantics hid NoIdempotencyKey's second bug (§16).

A `Claim` judges a set of runs:
- `Some(es...)`: one run meets them all;
- `All(es...)`: every run meets them all;
- `None(es...)`: no run meets any of them.

An expectation alone is a claim about some run, and `Conforms` is about
every run (a flag on the expectation, not its description). Several
claims are judged one by one, and each failing claim is reported with the
run that shows why. A `Some` claim that no run meets, while every run
conforms, names the fault kinds no run faulted: the usual reason a bug
did not show. No call site passed several expectations meaning "one run
with all", so the change broke no test.

`qhegel.Violation` now carries the shrunk run's full report: the
shrunk run is checked once more, since cached verdicts keep only their
summary. With `Violation.Expect`, the four tests that matched strings in
summaries state their verdicts like the rest (`Rejects("rotateGen")`,
`Violates("convergedWhenSettled")`).

## 19. Choices aligned to steps (U3)

A run had two records that did not meet: the steps it recorded and the
choices it made.
- A Script waiting for the steps before a fault needed a `Progress`
  closure wired to the run's sink by hand.
- A shrunk Hegel failure kept its steps but not its choices, so it could
  not be replayed outside Hegel, run on gosim, or kept as a seed.

**`Choice.Step`.** `qenv.ChoiceLog` stamps every choice with the run's step
count (`qobs.Recorder.Count`). The run's recorder is found once, through
qrun, on the first choice. A choice's step says which step a fault came
after, what fault-to-action coverage will build on. A Script with no
`Progress` waits on the same count, so `FaultScript`'s callers set
nothing.

**`qhegel.Case.Env(c)`** is the chooser a test case's simulation
runs on: `c`'s choices recorded into the case's recorder, the recorder in
the chooser's context. It replaces
`qenv.WithContext(qhegel.Choices(tc), rec.Context(ctx))`. The shrunk
`Violation` carries its `Choices`. Checkout's write-skew test replays
them with `qenv.Replay`: the same steps, rejected the same way, with no
Hegel in the run.

Writing that test hit P3 of the review: `qtest.Check` fails a test on a
violation before `.Expect` can say it was wanted. The test uses
`Validate`.

## 20. One system, every workflow (`qtest.System`, U4)

Each workflow wired the same pieces by hand: a scenario that runs the
app, its recorder, the chooser's context, and the binding passed again at
every call.
- connect's trace-following test was 40 lines of `GenerateRun`,
  `FaultScript`, a sink, a recorder and the `Progress` closure.
- Checkout's tests called `t.Fatal` from seeds' goroutines.

`qtest.System{Binding, Constants, Opts, Run}` binds an application to its
model once. `Run(c) error` deploys and runs it on a chooser. An error
means it could not run, which fails the test and names the seed; it is
not a verdict.
- `sys.Explore(t, cfg)` explores seeds. `ExploreConfig.Chooser` gives
  each seed its own chooser instead of a seeded one.
- `sys.Sweep(t, sw)` sweeps covering rows, the System's own Run reading
  the row from its chooser (`qtest.RowOf`, V4; W4 removed the per-sweep
  run function, and `qsweep.FaultKind` factors turn kinds off).
- `sys.FollowTraces(t, trace, faults)` generates the model's traces,
  scripts each one's faults, runs the system on each script, and fails a
  run whose script did not complete (`Remaining`), the P6 message.
- `qhegel.Shrink(t, sys, rates)` lives in qhegel, which imports qtest:
  Hegel stays out of qtest. It is FindViolation over `sys.Run` on
  `rec.Env(Choices(tc))`.

connect's test is now a System and two calls. It runs in 5 s instead of
9 s, because Explore checks the traces' runs in one batch. Checkout's
replay of its shrunk write skew is an exploration of one seed whose
chooser is `qenv.Replay(v.Choices)`.

Left for later: one `Run` type for exploration runs, Violations and
qgosim's, and `gotogether scaffold` printing a System skeleton.

## 21. Production workloads from SimKube traces (`sktrace`, D1–D2)

SimKube captures what happens to a real cluster's objects (sk-tracer)
and replays it on KWOK. It has no determinism, no faults and no oracle:
for us it is a source of workloads.

**`sktrace`** reads its trace format (v3: msgpack of `{version, config,
events, index}`) with a decoder of the subset it uses. The core module
stays free of a msgpack dependency.
- Events are the objects applied and deleted each second.
- The index gives pods' lifetimes, keyed by the owner's version.
- Derived views:
  - `Rates` (events per second of a tick);
  - `Gauge` (a value over the objects alive at each tick: desired
    replicas with `Replicas`);
  - `Starts` (pod starts per second).

SimKube's three example traces are its test data. The CronJob trace
shows why the index is keyed by version: the CronJob's second version
runs 45 s jobs where the first ran 30 s.

**D2, measured load shapes.** `qload.Piecewise(tick, scale, values...)`
makes a series a load shape. The scaling trace's desired replicas (27, up
to 52, back to 42) at 0.2 requests/s each pass the server's capacity for
two minutes and settle at 8.4 requests/s. Backoff alone stays in the
storm in 2 of 3 seeds; immediate retries and the budgets recover in all
3. It is the same ranking as the synthetic spike's, on a cluster's own
scale-up.

**D1, a replayed workload.** `kubesim.Fleet.Replay` plays the trace's
Deployment scalings onto the fleet's members, 60 times faster, as
another writer, while the rollout runs, through the same faults.
- The first replay showed the model had no other writers: a
  non-rollout update had no step.
- `scale` is the environment's spec change, recorded at the API server
  for writes marked with `kubesim.AsWriter`. The generation moves on, and
  the cluster is complete again only when its status catches up.
- With it, the faithful controller conforms over 30 seeds (540 scale
  steps), and `IgnoreObservedGeneration` is still caught.

## 22. Profiles and measured service (B1–B2)

**B1, labels by role.** `qrole.Labels(true)` makes `Serve`, `Operation` and
`Call`, and so the woven `//quint:serve`, `//quint:operation` and
`//quint:call`, set goroutine labels while the role lasts:
`quint.serve=<server>`, `quint.operation=<service>`,
`quint.call=<service>`. A CPU profile then splits by server and service.
It is off by default, since a label set allocates. It needed no hook
refactor (review S5): the roles' runtime functions set the labels, and
the aspects are unchanged.

**B2, measured service.** `qmeta.Measure(samples)` summarizes a handler's
latencies, run alone:
- the mean, and `Mu` for the chain;
- the coefficient of variation `CV`, 1 for the chain's exponential
  service;
- `Exponential()`, whether that approximation is fair;
- `Draw`, the measured distribution for `qload.ServerConfig.Service` or a
  `qenv.Capacity`.

It changed a verdict. At the same mean (100 ms), constant service
recovers from the spike in 0 of 6 seeds where exponential service
recovers in 6 of 6.
- Constant service keeps a healthy queue half as long, but the spike fills
  it to 100 requests: 10 s of work against a 9 s timeout. Every request in
  it then times out, with certainty, and the server works only on
  requests nobody waits for.
- Under exponential service some still finish in time, and the queue
  drains.

The chain, being exponential, predicts the recovery. The measurement's CV
of 0 is the warning. I had expected the opposite: that regular service
would time out less.

## 23. Fuzzing over the Chooser (A3)

**One byte rule (`qenv.Bytes`).** A schedule choice is a byte modulo n.
A fault is nominal when its byte is below 256 × (1 − rate), and otherwise
1 plus a byte modulo n − 1. Past the end of the stream every choice is
nominal. The rule lived in qhegel's chooser and, in another form, in
the gosim fork. It is now qenv's: Hegel's chooser is the rule over Hegel's
draws, and `FromBytes` is the rule over a fixed input. `EncodeChoices`
inverts it: a recorded run, or a shrunk Hegel failure's choices, becomes
the bytes that make it again. A test turns checkout's shrunk write skew
into an 834-byte corpus entry that replays to the same steps and the same
rejection.

**`System.Fuzz(f, cfg, seeds...)`** (cfg an ExploreConfig since V5). Each fuzz input is one run on
`FromBytes(input)`, judged by the model. `go test` runs the corpus and the
seeds; `go test -fuzz` explores, guided by coverage of the code under
test. Seeds and Hegel are random and shrinking respectively; neither is
guided by coverage.

**Verdicts by steps.** With quint judging every input, the fuzzer made 16
runs in 90 s. Most mutations change bytes that the run's model-level
steps do not show (a schedule choice between equivalent tasks, a byte
past the faults that matter). `qtest.VerdictCache` keys verdicts by the
steps, with recorder, process and thread ids renumbered by first
appearance and times left out. With it, the same 90 s made 14,633 runs
and found 30 inputs reaching new code. The cache also deduplicates
identical runs within one exploration. CI fuzzes the faithful shop for 60
s.

**Found on the way.** The scheduler's self-check (`GOTOGETHER_CHECK=1`) failed
on a test with frequent crashes: "task is past its deadline and not
runnable". A task killed while it waits keeps its deadline and rightly
never runs again. The check excluded killed tasks in its timer clause but
not in the deadline clause. The fix is to the check, not the scheduler;
`TestSelfCheckUnderCrashes` keeps it.

## 24. Chooser wrappers see through (U5, S2)

`EntropyOf` and `nemesisOf` switched on the package's own wrapper types,
and `New` and `ContextOf` looked only at the outermost chooser. So a
user's wrapper, or a `Script` over a `Base` carrying the run's context,
hid the context, the entropy (gosim runs about 9× slower without it) and
nemeses by name. `Swarm` and `Without` had to re-hoist the context by
hand.

A wrapper now implements `Unwrap() Chooser` (`qenv.Wrapper`), as
`WithContext`, `Recorder`, the swarm, `Script` (over its `Base`) and
qgosim's entropy wrapper do. `As[T](c)` finds the first `T` in the chain,
and the lookups walk it. A Recorder still intercepts what it passes on,
to record it. The hand re-hoisting is gone, and so is the gotcha that a
wrapper of a `WithContext` chooser must keep the context outermost.

## 25. Fault options by name (U5, S3)

A fault choice was an index, and the same kind took different option
counts at different calls: `kube.request` has 2 options on a Get (fail)
and 3 on an Update (fail, applied with the response lost). Coverage's
`Injected[2]` then meant nothing without knowing the call, and a
`Scripted{Option: 2}` panicked if a Get came up first.

`qenv.DeclareFaults(name, options...)` declares a kind's options, nominal
unnamed, and `Sim.FaultOf(kind)` returns "" or the option's name.
`kind.Only(...)` restricts a call to a prefix of the options, and only to
a prefix, so an option's number means the same option at every call. A
non-prefix panics. With that invariant:
- coverage names options from the declaration ("lostResponse 13");
- `Scripted.Name` maps to the option's number;
- a choice that does not offer the scripted option leaves the fault
  waiting, where it panicked before. The reads pass, and the first update
  loses its response.

The doubles (RPC, queue, store), kubesim and crossdb declare their kinds;
nothing in the byte rule, the recordings or the rates changed. The
`fault.` prefix in rates, `Without` and `Swarm` is still a second
spelling; changing it would break every rate table, so it stays until a
breaking release.

## 26. Mutant schemata (A2)

Coverage says which code ran; it does not say whether the model cares
what the code did. A mutant answers that: change the code, explore, and
see whether any run is rejected. A survivor in covered code is code the
model does not constrain.

Building one binary per mutant costs a link per mutant, and a simulation's
explorations are short. `qweave -mutate` instead weaves every mutant of
the main module (or `-coverpkg`) into one build, each behind a switch
(mutant schemata):
- an `if` condition `c` becomes `quintqmut.Cond(id, c)`, negated when on;
- a pure comparison (operands without calls) becomes
  `quintqmut.Pick(id, a < b, a <= b)`: its boundary moved; an `if` whose
  condition is one gets both, nested;
- a call statement (not `panic` or `print`) becomes
  `if !quintqmut.On(id) { call }`: dropped.

Each file registers its mutants at init (`qmut.Register`), with the
function, the operator and a one-line snippet. A run turns one on with
`qmut.WithMutant(ctx, id)`, found through qrun like a recorder, so seeds of
one mutant, or of different mutants, run in parallel in one process. A
`qmut.Reach` notes the mutants whose code a run reached, on or off.

`qtest.System.Mutate` explores the baseline (which must conform, and
gives the reach), then each reached mutant with the same seeds. A mutant
is killed by a rejected run, a `Run` error or a panic. The explorations
share a `VerdictCache`: most mutants' runs repeat steps already checked.

On checkout (SnapshotIsolation, 20 crashy seeds, about 8 minutes):
67 mutants reached, 12 unreached. The first run killed 48. A survivor was
`Cancel` dropping `tx.Put("stock/"+sku, stock+qty)`: the model restocks on
cancel, but no step carried the stock and the binding compared nothing.
Place and cancel now record `obs.stock`, and the binding expects
`stock == {{.obs.stock}}`; the restock mutant is killed (49, 73%). The
other survivors:
- equivalent under the environment: dropped acks (the queue redelivers,
  the consumers are idempotent), dropped rollbacks (an uncommitted
  transaction is discarded), the retry loop's boundary and its sleep, a
  fourth payment worker;
- the relay's `Delete` of a sent outbox row: resending is idempotent;
- mutation switches (`NoLocks`, `DualWrite`) negated: equivalent under
  snapshot isolation, or a race the seeds did not reach;
- `PlaceOrder`'s error branches (`err != nil`, `ok` negated): a shop that
  places nothing records nothing, and a safety model accepts a run with no
  steps;
- the refusal's own recording (two mutants dropping it) and the
  `ErrSoldOut` return negated: a missing refusal is a step the model
  cannot require (a client may give up before any), and the client's
  answer is no step.

Refusals are steps (V17). A refused order recorded nothing, so the stock
check was unconstrained both ways. The model has `refuse(order, qty)`,
enabled only when `stock < qty`, and changes nothing. The shop records it
from its read-only transaction's commit: returning ErrSoldOut from the
transaction would roll back and drop the hook, so it returns nil and the
error after. The binding compares the stock. Both stock-check mutants
(negated, `<=` for `<`) are now killed: 70 reached, 51 killed (73%), 19
survive, 12 unreached. The three new mutants, in the refusal code, survive:
they are among the bullets above.

The report is a list to read, not a score to assert: equivalent mutants
survive by right. `examples/checkout/mutate_test.go` logs it.

## 27. Messages, constants and one recovery API (U6: P6, P5, P4)

**Messages for the traps (P6).** The review's traps each cost a debugging
session; each now has its message where the trap shows:
- an exploration whose every run fails at step 1 names the binding's
  constants: the instance more likely disagrees with the scenario's than
  every run has one bug (`Exploration.Expect`);
- runs whose Script never made all its faults list them, in the run's
  report and in "all N runs conform; want ..." (`Explored.Unscripted`);
- every failing run's report ends with how to reproduce it:
  `GOTOGETHER_RUN='TestX#1:seed=17' go test -run '^TestX$'` (Y2; it was
  `GOTOGETHER_SEED`, which every exploration of the test read), and that
  exploration runs the seed alone;
- a recovery judged against goodput far below the offered load says the
  baseline was unhealthy (`Recovery.Warning`, in its `String`);
- a chain whose arrival rate is at or above capacity says so, and that a
  calibration that got there was fed storm data (`Params.Warning`).

**Run-declared constants (P5).** A sweep's size went to the system and to
the model separately, and rows failed until both agreed. A factor now
names its model constant (`qsweep.Ints("stock", 1, 2, 3).Constant("STOCK")`)
and each row is checked with it (`Row.Constants`). The run-attribute form
(a run declaring its instance in its recording) would let one batch mix
instances; the checker validates a batch against one instance, so it
waits until a sweep's rows are checked in one batch.

**One recovery API (P4).** `qmeta.System` is the one interface: a qload
simulation (`OfSimulation`) or an application (`Of`), run with `Runs`,
`Count` and `Mostly`. `RecoversMostly` and `SearchTrigger` are gone, and
`qhegel.FindTrigger(t, sys, space)` takes any System and returns a
`TriggerSearch` judged by `Expect(t, found)`, as FindViolation's result
is. `MaxExtraRate` no longer defaults to the base rate (the System does
not know it): set it.

## 28. Small unifications (U7: S5, S6, S7)

**S7, the orbit.** The chain's v is the papers' orbit: an arrival that
will time out enters u and v together, and leaves v after the timeout
and the backoff. That is `qload.Sample.Orbit`, known in hindsight. qrole's
v (operations in progress with no attempt in flight) is what a running
system can see: the waiting part, now also `Sample.Waiting`, so one run
has both. In the paper's storm (9.5 req/s, a spike to 20) the orbit is 79
and the waiting part 0 under immediate retries; with a 5 s backoff, 215
and 134 (`TestTwoOrbits`). So:
- a chain calibrated on qrole's gauges (`CalibrateTimeout`) is a chain of
  the waiting part, and its fitted timeout absorbs the attempts in flight;
- under immediate retries v is invisible to a running system, and an
  alert on it sees only u. retrystorm's alerts are on backoff, where
  the waiting part is most of the orbit.

**S6, duplicates.** The simulation lint moved from qenv to
`internal/lint` (then `qlint`, §31): gosim translates everything a simulated package imports,
and qenv pulled go/ast, go/parser and go/token into every translation.
`Run.Faults` (then `Explored.Faults`) reuses `Recorder.Faults`. Kept: qload's step counter,
which samples per tick inside the simulation (merging it with
`qrole.MetricsSink` would make qload depend on OTel metrics), and the
simdeps list, which a derivation could only replace with a deny-list of
host packages or a gosim build of examples/gosim.

**S5, one hook entry.** Superseded: B1 put the pprof labels in qrole's
one `track`, which Serve, Operation and Call share; a hook package would
add an indirection for three call sites.

## 29. One evidence report (U8, P8)

A green exploration said "every run conforms" and nothing about what the
runs did. Its other reports (fault coverage, code coverage, a sweep's
rows, mutants) were separate calls with separate formats. `Evidence`
puts them in one: verdicts by reason ("violates chargedAtMostOnce",
"rejects ship", "mismatch after place"), fault kinds faulted and pairs
together, rows, code and mutants, each part present when its data is.
`Exploration.Evidence` and `SweepResult.Evidence` make it; a mutation report is
added by the caller (`Mutants`), since `System.Mutate` runs explorations
of its own.

The review's other parts of P8 wait: coverage gaps as expectations
(`Reaches`, `NoSurvivors`) need a decision on what a test may demand of
chance (a pair of kinds is reached in most seeds, not all), and a JSON
form next to `GOTOGETHER_KEEP` needs the reports' types to marshal.

## 30. Choreo models (examples/twophase)

[Choreo](https://github.com/informalsystems/choreo) is Informal's
framework for distributed protocols in Quint: nodes with local state, a
message soup (messages are delivered by being in a node's inbox, never
lost or reordered away), and listeners returning the transitions a node
can take. Its `step` picks a node and a transition itself:
`nondet v = oneOf(processes)` in the framework and `nondet transition =
oneOf(transitions)` in `process_transitions`. Two consequences for us:
- a recorded step says "p2 prepared"; nothing in a `step`-only model can
  be called with that;
- `quint run --mbt` reports `mbt::actionTaken = step` and a transition
  record, which a driver could only match by its post-state.

Choreo already has the deterministic form: `choreo::step_with(node,
listener, effects)` runs one listener for one node (its own tests use it),
and `with_cue(...).perform(...)` one transition with parameters. A model
that names each transition as an action of its node over `step_with`, and
chooses among those in `step`, is a model like any other: bindings call
`prepare("p2")`, `--mbt` names the action and the node, and connect
compares a driver's state with `choreo::s.system`. So "supporting Choreo"
needed no code: connect already strips the `m::choreo::` qualifiers, and
the replay module imports the model, whose relative imports find the
vendored framework.

What the example taught:
- Choreo's message soup is a good fit for an implementation over a lossy
  network: a lost message is a transition not yet taken, a duplicate is a
  message already in the set. Retries need no model of their own.
- The implementation's protocol state is the model's local state, so the
  steps are recorded where the stage changes, in the node's store
  (OnCommit): a crash after the commit keeps the step.
- `choreo::s` is module-private; a binding's expectations need a def
  (`stage(n)`) in the model.
- Choreo's listeners leave role guards to the local state; the named
  action should check the node is of the right kind, since the node now
  comes from the code.
- Of three mutants, the model's traces (connect) catch one (committing on
  the first vote); the two that need a late decision or a crash show
  only in explored runs: the same split as bank's, now on a protocol.

## 31. Analyzers and the static action map (C1, C5)

**Analyzers (C1).** `gotogether lint -sim` and `-weave` were directory
walks; the analyzers wrap the same per-file checks (`qlint.SimFile`,
`WovenFile`), so the CLI and quintvet agree finding for finding, and
`gotogether lint` stays std-only. x/tools went into a new module,
qanalysis, not qweave: qweave is a build tool with no dependency on the
core, the analyzers need the core's binding and lint packages, and a
golangci-lint plugin is a dependency of its own that a weaver should not
carry. quintaction adds what the CLI could not check without types: an
annotation's expressions may use only parameters, the receiver and named
results, since the advice records on return, at the top of the body,
where locals are out of scope. With `-binding` it runs
`binding.LintAnnotations` per annotation (loading the model once per
process: it runs quint). Run on edgepublish with its binding it reports
the same as the CLI: `probe`'s `woven` action is not in the model (the
weaving probe; left as is).

It also checks explicit steps: the literal action of every `qobs.Record`
and `(*qobs.Recorder).Record` call must be one of the model's
(`binding.LintRecords`, with the nearest action and the list). The scan
is the binding package's (`binding.RecordsOf`, syntax only, so the CLI
shares it); the analyzer confirms each call is qobs's by type, which the
CLI approximates by skipping calls on other imported packages. quintsim
checks test files, like `gotogether lint -sim`: a System's `Run` closure is
test code, and a `go` statement there escapes the run as surely as one
in the library.

gopls cannot load third-party analyzers; editors get them through
golangci-lint (the module plugin `gotogether`) or `go vet -vettool`.

**Static action map (C5).** A1 says which code each step ran; the map
says which code each action can run. Sites are `//quint:action`
functions and functions calling `qobs.Record` with a constant action
(checkout records in `OnCommit` closures, so a site's closures count as
the site). Reachability is a VTA call graph from the sites, stopping at
functions outside the loaded packages. Without the stop, every closure
handed to qenv's commit hooks was reachable from every other, and cancel
reached PlaceOrder. Names follow qcover (`pkg.(T).M`, closures under their
declaration), so the two maps compare function by function.

On checkout (30 crashy seeds at SI):
- `Deploy` is run by the first step of every task: setup, attributed to
  the task's next step (A1's rule), and reachable from no site;
- markPaid's steps run `RunPayments` and `inbox.Receive`, which `pay`
  does not reach: code that leads to a step lives in the site's callers,
  which downward reachability cannot see;
- `settle`'s site is the run driver (`RunOn`), so it reaches everything,
  and all of it runs under other actions: a driver-recorded step says
  nothing about code;
- nothing reachable from a shop site went unrun.

Deviation: "blocks" reachable was planned; the map is by function. qcover
blocks carry their function, and an SSA block is not a qcover block (the
weaver splits at statements, SSA at control flow), so blocks would need a
position join for little gain over A1's never-run list.

## 32. Skills restructured (U8, P7)

Eight skills had grown to 1,500 lines, the fault-injection one to 411:
an agent loading it for a first exploration read weaving, gosim, sweeps,
fuzzing, coverage and mutants too. Now:
- `gotogether-start` is the entry: a question-to-tool table naming the skill
  to load next (and the same table heads the README);
- gotogether-faults keeps the workflow (seams, recording, deploy,
  explore and shrink, the real environment) in 202 lines, and its
  mechanics are references loaded when the task needs them
  (`references/fuzzing.md`, `fault-points.md`, `coverage-and-mutants.md`,
  `sweeps.md`, `weaving.md`, `gosim.md`, `workloads.md`);
- verdicts, expectations and claims over runs are one reference
  (`gotogether-workflow/references/verdicts.md`) the other skills
  link to, instead of each restating them.

`gotogether skills install` installs the references with the skills, and a
test checks every relative link between them resolves among the
installed files.

## 33. A flight recorder on alert, and a virtual-time profile (B3, B4)

**B3.** The alert rule (§16, `Region.Rules`) says a system is in a state
it is unlikely to leave in time; it cannot say what the code was doing.
Go's flight recorder (`runtime/trace.FlightRecorder`, Go 1.25) keeps the
last seconds of execution trace in memory. `qmeta.Watch` samples qrole's
(u, v) on the real clock, and once the state has been in the region for
`For` samples it writes the recorder's window out (at most once per
`Gap`): the storm's first seconds, with every goroutine's blocking and
scheduling. It is a production tool; the lint does not flag its ticker
because its file does not import qenv. One flight recorder may run per
process.

**B4.** A CPU profile of a simulation shows the scheduler: virtual time
costs nothing. `qenv.TimeProfile` records, at every wait of a task (Sleep,
Wait, a Signal: calls, locks, queues all wait through them), the stack
and the virtual time until the task ran again, and writes pprof's format.
The roadmap put it in a module of its own for pprof's protobuf; the five
message types it needs are hand-encoded instead (`pbuf`), so the core
takes no dependency. Two details: a return address is looked up as
itself (`CallersFrames` steps back to the call, inlined frames included;
handing it the call's address attributed an inlined call to its
neighbour), and a wait a crash cuts off is not counted (the killed task
never returns from park). The native runtime does not record it.

## 34. A real environment's coverage, and synctest (C3, C2)

**C3.** Go's `-cover` counters are global to a process and written to
`GOCOVERDIR` at exit: a real environment's binaries (Maelstrom nodes, a
kwok controller, an HTTP server) can report what they ran, but not under
which step. What a real environment can say is the comparison with the
simulation: `qcover.ReadGoCover` merges the runs' data with `go tool
covdata textfmt`, and `Compare` matches a simulation's blocks (by file
and line; Go's files are import paths, qcover's module-relative) over the
files the binaries contain. Code that ran for real and in no simulated
run is where the simulation's verdicts are silent: the doubles never take
that path. `gotogether cover -covdir ... -sim summary.json` prints both lists.

**C2.** The review's advice held: qenv's native runtime with no platform
(`NewNative(c, nil)`) waits with `time.Sleep`, `time.AfterFunc` and a
`sync.Cond`, all of which a `testing/synctest` bubble fakes and counts as
blocking. Checkout runs in a bubble unchanged (`TestNativeInSynctest`):
80 s of its timeouts, retries and redeliveries pass on the bubble's clock
in a few seconds, with real goroutines and Go's scheduler. The schedule
is Go's, so a run is not reproducible from its seed (its faults still
are the chooser's); it is for timing behaviour, next to qenv's own
scheduler for interleavings. No runtime interface was needed.

## 35. Structured logs as a step source (C4)

Many services already log what they did, with `log/slog`'s attributes.
`qobs.SlogHandler` wraps the application's handler: a record with the
attribute `quint.action` is also a step, recorded into the run of the
record's context, its other attributes the step's fields as `Record`
takes them (`obs.*`, `order.*`, arguments; groups join with "."), and an
`error` attribute its error. Every record still reaches the wrapped
handler, at that handler's level; a step is recorded at any level, since
the model needs every step and the log only what it keeps. Unlike
`convert` for spans, there are no rules: logs are written by the
application, so it can name the action, which a span's library cannot.

## 36. Selecting and sanitizing step logs (D4)

A production log is checked by people who should not see customers'
identifiers, and is mostly steps a check does not need. `qtrace.Filter`
selects (actors and actions by pattern, a time window: an actor is a
trace, so selecting by actor keeps whole runs) and sanitizes:
- pseudonyms for chosen fields: a salted SHA-256 prefix, the same for the
  same value, so the binding's interning and the model's comparisons
  mean what they did. Unsalted pseudonyms of guessable values (account
  names) are reversible; the CLI warns without `GOTOGETHER_SALT`;
- minimizing: with a binding, every argument and observation the binding
  does not read is dropped, and error texts with them
  (`Binding.UsedFields`, the same field analysis the annotation lint
  uses).

A model constant listing concrete identifiers must list their pseudonyms
(`Filter.Pseudonym`), as examples/bank's `TestSanitizedRunConforms`
does; interning the field avoids the question. `gotogether steps -out`
applies a filter and writes a step log for `gotogether validate`.

## 37. Scenario lint, measured pod times, dead code and untried error paths (D5, D3, A1)

**D5.** A replayed trace assumes a cluster: its first event applies pods
into a namespace it never created (all three of SimKube's example traces
do), owners may arrive after their pods, and a trace that starts mid-run
deletes objects it never applied. `sktrace.Trace.Lint(env)` checks each
event against a target that starts as `env` (namespaces, served kinds)
and says what to create or skip; a replay that ignored these fails at the
API server, or replays less than the trace recorded.

**D3.** kubesim's pods became ready after 100 to 300 ms by a schedule
choice. A trace's pod lifetimes (`Lifetimes`, from its index) give a
measured distribution; `Quantiles(ds, n)` makes n options of it, shortest
first, so option 0 stays nominal and Hegel's shrinking still moves toward
fast pods. fleetrollout's `Config.PodTimes` uses the CronJob trace's 30 s
and 45 s pods, 60 times faster: the faithful controller conforms and the
stale-status mutant is still caught.

The kwok tier is timed by the same numbers (R3). `fleetrollout.KwokStages`
turns `sktrace.Quantiles(tr.Lifetimes(gvk), n)` into kwok pod Stages, one
weighted pod-ready stage per option: the discrete, uniform choice kubesim
makes with `sched.kube.pod`. A real cluster's pods then become ready as
slowly as the trace's did. The generator lives in the example, not in
sktrace: sktrace stays a dependency-free decoder, and the stages'
templates are kwok's (v0.7.0's kustomize/stage/pod/fast), copied
unchanged. A test loads them with kwok's own config loader and matches
pods with its lifecycle package.

**A1, the rest.** Two classifications of code no run ran, both in
qanalysis/actionmap, which has the call graph:
- `Map.Dead`: own functions no root reaches (main, init, the exported API
  of library packages): dead, as `deadcode` reports, under qcover's names;
- `UntriedErrorPaths`: for a fault point the runs reached and never
  faulted (`Coverage.Unfaulted`), the blocks no run ran in its callers,
  where the fault's error is handled. A fault point is at its function's
  entry, so its error path is in the callers: qcover alone, without a
  call graph, could not place it. Read these as untried before reading
  them as dead: raise the kind's rate or script it.

## 38. gRPC services, simulated and for real (examples/grpcledger)

A gRPC service is checked the way checkout is, with one new seam:
`simgrpc` (examples/grpcledger/simgrpc, ~150 lines), which runs any
generated service inside qenv.
- `Server` implements `grpc.ServiceRegistrar`, so the generated
  `RegisterXServer` registers the real handlers. `Conn` implements
  `grpc.ClientConnInterface`, so `NewXClient` works unchanged.
- A call is protobuf-marshalled and crosses a `qenv.Service`, whose faults
  (dropped or duplicated request, lost response) and process crashes are
  qenv choices. simgrpc adds one kind of its own: a connection refused
  before sending.
- Transport outcomes become the status codes a real client sees:
  - no response in the connection's virtual Timeout: `DeadlineExceeded`,
    outcome unknown;
  - a full queue: `ResourceExhausted`;
  - a refused connection: `Unavailable`.
- Handler errors pass through as their status, and outgoing metadata
  arrives as incoming metadata.
- Streams, peers and the transport's own retries are not simulated. The
  client's retry policy lives in the client (`ledger.Client`), so both
  tiers run it.

The real tier serves the same handlers on a `grpc.Server` with otelgrpc.
At the commit, the server stamps its own span with the step
(`ledger.action`, fields, `ledger.seq` for commit order). The convert
rules (`ledger.convert.yaml`) then make the spans the steps, which is how a
production gRPC service would be checked from traces it already exports.
`gotogether validate -convert` checks them from the command line
(`run-demo.sh`).

What the example found:
- **The example's own first draft deadlocked.** Lock order was src, then
  dest; the faithful exploration's seed 22 recorded no steps. The
  simulation had found a real bug, but Explore said only "does not show
  the run conforms" with an empty report.
- **No crash window between commit and response.** A sweep row with
  crashes on and the network faults off conformed under `NoDedupe`.
- **Refusals are steps.** The model allows a refusal only when funds are
  short, so a ledger that wrongly refuses is caught too. (Checkout's open
  question, refused orders that record no step, is the same design point.)

Deviations from the brief:
- Unary RPCs only; NewStream returns `Unimplemented` in the simulation.
- The client's retry is in the client, not a gRPC service-config
  retryPolicy: the transport's retries cannot run over simgrpc, and a
  policy in code runs in both tiers.
- `SplitTxn` is checked in the simulation only. With MemDB's one lock per
  transaction, the real interleaving is a race the load rarely hits.
- No protoc on the machine: buf v1.50.0 compiles the proto, with
  protoc-gen-go v1.36.12 and protoc-gen-go-grpc v1.6.0. The generated
  code is checked in and the regeneration command reproduces it byte for
  byte.

## 39. Streams on Kafka and Kinesis (examples/streams)

A publisher relays a transactional outbox to a partitioned log;
consumers apply records to a projection, deduplicated by a per-key
version, and commit offsets after a batch. One model, one binding and
three logs: qenv's simulated log, Kafka through franz-go, and Kinesis
through the AWS SDK.

**The model learns the log from reads.** A broker's appends are not
observable in every tier. A real cluster has no hook, and recording at
the producer's acknowledgement misses records whose acknowledgement was
lost. So the model takes the log from the consumers' `read(partition,
offset, key, n)`: the first read of an offset learns its record, later
reads must agree, and an offset past what was read is not a step. The
properties are over the projection (`apply`), the commits (`commit`) and
what the publisher was told (`publish`). The binding has no templates.

**A simulated partitioned log, not qenv.Queue.** qenv's Queue is
per-message acknowledgement with redelivery, and has no offsets,
partitions or groups. simlog (in the example module) is Kafka's contract:
- an idempotent producer client: sequence numbers per partition, the log
  rejecting out-of-order and dropping duplicates, 5 requests in flight;
- commits with lost requests and acknowledgements;
- rewinds;
- a consumer group with generations, eager rebalances and fencing;
- evictions as nemeses at any step (mid-batch: the zombie keeps
  applying while the new owner re-reads; the serializable projection and
  the version keep it idempotent).

It belongs in core only if a second example needs it. Kinesis's contract
is a subset (no idempotence, no groups), so it could serve that too.

**Findings while building it.**
- An argument named `seq` collides with the step's own field in binding
  templates (proposed core fix below).
- A publisher that republished everything on restart livelocked runs at
  per-step crash rates; the outbox fixed it, as it would in production.
- On a nominal run a plain test of the projection sees only `off-by-one`.
  The other three bugs need a fault, and the model names the property
  each breaks. `commit-first` needs no crash for the model:
  `committedApplied` fails at the commit itself.

**Deviations.**
- The real tiers inject no faults: kfake and the fake Kinesis run
  nominally. Their value is that the real clients, the adapters and the
  model agree.
- Kinesis runs one consumer owning every shard. Leases are the KCL's,
  with DynamoDB, and out of scope.
- Kinesis needed a fake endpoint (four calls of the JSON 1.1 protocol),
  not a Docker image (none needed: in process, like kfake).

## 40. What the examples asked of the core

The gRPC and streams examples found four things the core got wrong or
could not say; each is fixed where it belongs:
- **A step argument named like a step field** (`seq`) was shadowed in
  templates by the recorder's sequence number: `apply(seq=1)` replayed as
  `apply(4)`, and the error said only "not a transition". Arguments now
  win, and the step's own are `.step.seq` and `.step.action`.
- **Deadlocks were silent.** Two transactions taking row locks in
  opposite orders waited forever, the run recorded nothing, and Explore
  failed it with an empty report. `qenv.Store` now walks the lock-wait
  chain at each `GetForUpdate` and aborts the transaction that would close
  a cycle (`ErrDeadlock`, an `ErrConflict`), as PostgreSQL does; and a run
  with no steps says so in its report.
- **No crash between commit and response.** `qenv.Service` delivered the
  response in the handler's scheduling step. A scheduling point there
  lets a crash fall after the commit; opt-in at first (`CrashWindow`),
  since it changes the choices of runs recorded before it, and the
  default since the third review (`NoCrashWindow` closes it).
  grpcledger's `TestCrashWindow` shows crashes alone exposing a
  missing dedupe.
- **A domain clock written `attr:x|int` was dropped.** convert appended
  `|int` to every `order:` expression, so `attr:ledger.seq|int` became
  `attr:ledger.seq|int|int`, the lookup failed, and the order was
  silently empty: grpcledger's real-tier steps were ordered by span time,
  which concurrent requests contradict, and CI failed one run in a few.
  convert now adds `|int` only when missing, and grpcledger gives each
  request its own thread (`thread: span_id`), so a shared thread does
  not assert span time order as program order.
- **Long failing runs seemed slow to validate** (17 to 30 s for 160 to
  500 steps, measured while four agents shared the machine). Measured
  alone: a failing run costs one more quint run, the detail module (each
  step's expectation, ITF for the failing checks), about 3 s of quint's
  startup whatever its length (bank, 300 steps: 3.1 s conforming, 6.3 s
  failing; each quint invocation 3.3 to 3.5 s with or without ITF);
  streams' no-dedupe mutant, 20 seeds, 8 failing, validates in 13 s. All
  of a batch's failing runs share one detail run, so the cost is per
  batch, not per run. Nothing to fix; a machine under load multiplies it.

## 41. After the second review (ROADMAP V1–V17)

What changed in the core, and why, item by item (ROADMAP "Next" has the
plan; the commits have the detail).

**Boundaries (V10).** qmeta is the chain and its alerts, and imports
nothing of the module: the recovery property and the trigger search's
System (`Recovers`, `Assess`, `Of`, `OfSimulation`, `System`,
`TriggerSpace`, `Runs`, `Count`, `Mostly`, `Window`) run simulations, so
they are qload's, and `qmeta.Simulate` is `qload.SimulateTrajectory`.
qenv's choosers and their byte rule are `qenv/choice`, which needs no
simulation (a fuzz corpus, gosim's host side); the virtual-time profile
is `qenv/profile`. qenv re-exports both, so no caller changed. (The third review made both internal,
`qenv/internal/choice` and `qenv/internal/profile`: nothing but qenv
imported them, and two import paths for one API was one too many.) OTelSink
stayed in qobs: qobs reads a step's thread from the span in its context,
so it needs otel/trace whatever the sink's package.

**Faults (V11).** One registry (`choice.Declare`, `DeclareSite`) holds
each kind's option names and sites, so a recorded choice names its
option (`fault.rpc.counter.request=duplicate(2/3)`), a nemesis is
recorded by name (its options are the nemeses enabled at that moment,
which no declaration can name), and `FaultPoint` declares its kind from
its errors and `crash`. Declaring it made the numbering a rule: the
crash option exists whether or not the caller is in a process (outside
one it is nominal), and one kind has one option list. Scripts were a
strict order: a fault whose phase had passed blocked all later ones.
Each kind's faults are now in order and kinds independent, with
`Follows` for an order across kinds.

**Replay (V12).** A replay that diverged panicked in whichever task asked
for the choice, so an exploration with a stale recording died instead of
saying why. A Replayer now stops at the first divergence (the choice's
index, the steps before it, what was recorded and what was asked) and
makes every later choice nominal; the exploration reports the
divergence as the run's error. An encoded run (a fuzz corpus entry)
starts with the byte rule's version: a raw fuzz input has no header and
is choices as it is, and an entry of another version is an error with
its fix, not another run.

**Evidence (V13).** A passing exploration says nothing of the faults it
never took: `Reaches(kind).Faulted().InAtLeast(p)` is a claim about the
runs' choices, not their verdicts, so a test can state that the fault it
is about happened. The report names the pairs of kinds never in one run
and the ones only ever in one order. A mutation run's report keeps its
baseline, and `NoSurvivors(marks...)` makes survivors a failure unless
marked equivalent by position; a mark that matches no survivor is stale
and fails too. On the metastability side, `Assess` without a healthy
goodput is an error, not a verdict, and `qmeta.Healthy` is one value for
the region's predicate and the rules' description and PromQL, where a
func and a hand-written string could drift.

## 42. Exhaustive schedules, real time, contracts, clocks, disks, partitions (X)

**Exhaust (X3).** A seeded exploration samples; `System.Exhaust(t,
Bound{Delays, Faults})` enumerates every run within a bound: every way of
deviating from the canonical schedule at most `Delays` times and from
nominal at most `Faults` times, fewest deviations first (delay-bounded
scheduling, as in CHESS and Coyote, over qenv's choices). A run is named
by its deviations (`Run.Schedule`, "17:1,40:2"), so `GOTOGETHER_RUN`
reruns exactly it. A search `MaxRuns` cuts short fails unless
`Bound.Partial` says a sample is what the test wants (Y3): a forgotten
claim once turned a sample into what read as a proof. `Evidence.Search`
records the bound and what was left.

**Real time (X4).** A client records an operation when it returns, with
when it was invoked (`qobs.Record`'s `invoked`, a span's start), so a
step has an interval, not a point. `Reconstruct` orders steps by their
keys and reports an order the keys force that real time contradicts;
`qtrace.Linearize` searches the orders the intervals allow for one the
model accepts (guided: from the failing step, every single move
constraints allow, keeping the one that gets furthest). `qtest.Linearize`
checks a history so; finding none is strong evidence of a bug, a budget
running out is no verdict at all (Y6: n/a, which Rejects does not match).

**Contracts (X5).** A double is only as good as its contract. Under
`GOTOGETHER_CHECK` every `Store` keeps the history of its transactions
and checks, at each commit, the dependency cycles its isolation level
forbids (G1a, G1c, G-single, G2: Adya's phenomena, as Elle checks them);
a change to the store's validation that lets one commit panics there,
naming the cycle. Every `Queue` checks after each operation that no
message is lost, none is delivered after its acknowledgement, and an
Ordered queue's first deliveries are in order.

**Clocks (X6, Y4).** A process has two clocks, as a Go program does: the
wall clock (`qenv.Now`: skewed per process, jumping by nemesis, drifting)
and the monotonic one (`qenv.Mono`, `Since`, `WaitFor`: drift only),
which `time.Since` of two `time.Now` readings uses. The first version had
one clock that jumps, so "a lease timed on the holder's own clock breaks
on one jump" was the model's claim, not Go's; examples/lease now shows
each fault breaking the variant that trusts it (a skew, absolute
expiries; a jump, intervals on the wall clock; a drift past the margin,
intervals on the monotonic one) and fencing surviving all. Jumps are
nemeses, not choices at every read, so reading the clock makes no choice.

**Disks and partitions (X7, Y7).** `qenv.Disk` is a machine's disk:
writes reach the OS at once and the disk on `File.Sync`; a crash of its
process is a fault point (`disk.<name>.crash`: nominal keeps every write,
`powerLoss` the synced ones, `tornWrite` part of the last). It is what
tells "written" from "durable", which a sink's `qobs.PerStep` (one write
per step) and `qobs.Synced` (an fsync per step) differ in. The network
(`Sim.Net()`) cuts and heals links between processes, by hand or by a
nemesis (`PartitionNemesis`), which a `Service` call and a `Queue` whose
broker runs in a process (`NewQueue(s, name, p)`) see; a nemesis's cut
heals by itself after `CutLength`, since a network every task waits on
would otherwise never heal (a nemesis acts only at a scheduling step).

**Vacuity (X2).** An invariant `A implies B` holds in runs where `A`
never does, for nothing. `binding.Model.Antecedents` finds `A`, a binding
may name it, and `NotVacuous` fails when no run that passed witnessed
it, when one cannot be evaluated, or when no invariant has one (Y6).

**Corpus (X8, Y5).** A failing run's choices are saved and replayed
before the seeds, so a regression stays found whatever the seeds are. An
entry records its format and the exploration that saved it, which alone
replays it; one whose replay diverges is stale, with the seed that finds
its run again, and one no exploration replayed fails the test.

**Verify (X2).** `gotogether simulate -verify N` runs Apalache to depth
N on each invariant: "no trace of up to N steps violates it" where
sampling said only "none of the sampled traces". A binding caps N for a
model whose depth Apalache cannot reach in time (`simulate.verifySteps`)
or skips it (`verifySkip`: Choreo's recursion).

## 43. After the fifth review (ROADMAP Y1–Y12)

The fifth review read the X track as a user would, and found claims that
said more than they proved. The fixes share one rule: what a test does
not check, it says, and a name that matches nothing fails.
- A run's panic is a failing run, named and kept (Y1); a run reproduces
  alone, as its report prints it (`GOTOGETHER_RUN`, Y2); a truncated
  search fails (Y3); corpus entries say what they are (Y5).
- Claims are judged once (`Exploration.verdict`, for Expect and Mutate),
  `Exercised` counts each option and nemesis by name, nemesis families
  each have a rate, and `NotVacuous` and `Linearize` say when they cannot
  judge (Y6).
- Doubles take their process at construction and name their fault kinds
  after themselves; a Rates key, a sweep's FaultKind or an exception
  naming nothing declared fails (`KnownFault`, Y7). An option a workflow
  ignores fails (Y9).
- The API record lists fields, methods and values for every published
  module (Y8); evidence is a format with a role, so a suite's gaps count
  the system as it is, not its mutants (Y10); the core's Hegel
  properties test the current core (Y11).
