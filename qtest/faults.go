// "rpc.payments.response", or "nemesis.crash.<process>" for a crash).

// recorded as such); a step it does not record (a crash) does not count
// toward the steps the next faults wait for.

// precede it, and no others; the program makes every other step itself,
// and its recorded steps are then checked against the model
// (System.FollowTraces does it). A run that cannot follow the trace leaves faults in
// Script.Remaining, or records steps the model rejects.
//
// The script waits on the run's own step recorder (the one in the
// simulation's context); give it a Base chooser for the schedule if it
// should not be the nominal one.
