# examples/crossdb: a Crossplane provider, simulated and on kind

A Crossplane provider for a database-as-a-service, built on
crossplane-runtime's managed reconciler:
- a `Database` managed resource (namespaced, Crossplane v2) becomes a
  database in the dbaas cloud;
- its connection details (endpoint, username, password) are written back
  into the cluster as a Secret.

On kind, full Crossplane composes an `AppDatabase` platform API into
`Database`s.

The reconciler under test is **Crossplane's own**. This example supplies
the external client, configures the reconciler, and runs it in two
environments, checked by one model:

| | Simulated (`crossdb.Run`, on [`qenv`](../../qenv)) | Real (`kind/demo.sh`) |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes API | controller-runtime fake client behind interceptors: requests fail, or are applied with their response lost | kind, with Crossplane 2.4 and function-patch-and-transform |
| The cloud | `dbaas.Cloud` behind `qenv.Service`: lost or duplicated requests, lost responses, throttling, reads that lag creates | the same `Cloud` behind `cmd/dbaas-server`: dropped responses (`DROP`), throttling, reads that lag creates |
| The provider | the managed reconciler in a crashable process | `cmd/provider` out of cluster; `KILL=1` sends `kill -9` every 2–6 s |
| Users | clients create `Database`s, delete some | `cmd/driver` creates `AppDatabase`s (composed into `Database`s), deletes some |
| Steps | the cloud records its own operations; the clients record theirs; an audit after quiescence records each resource's phase and Secret | the same, from two durable step logs merged by wall clock |

The model (`model/crossdb.qnt`) has two properties:
- **`oneDatabasePerResource`:** a ghost flag, set when a resource gets a
  second live database.
- **`settledCorrectly`:** once quiet,
  - deletions have finished and leaked nothing;
  - every live resource has its one database and a Secret that opens it
    (the endpoint matches, and the password's fingerprint matches the
    cloud's).

```sh
go test ./...                                        # explorations and Hegel (~4 min)
./run-demo.sh                                        # the simulated tier; MUTANT=noClientToken | generatedExternalName | passwordFromCreate
kind/demo.sh                                         # kind + Crossplane; exit status is the verdict
KILL=1 kind/demo.sh                                  # kill -9 the provider every few seconds
MUTANT=noClientToken DROP=0.3 N=6 kind/demo.sh
```

`kind/setup.sh` creates the cluster and installs everything. It needs
Docker, kind, kubectl and helm. In sandboxed VMs:
- set `CA_BUNDLE=` for a TLS-intercepting proxy;
- the script already handles two host quirks, documented in it.

## The design, and what each mistake does

A Crossplane provider for a resource whose ID the cloud generates must
answer one question: what if the provider doesn't learn the outcome of a
create? A response can be lost, or the provider can crash before saving
the ID. The faithful provider's answer:
- **A deterministic external name.** The external name is a client token
  derived from the resource's UID, set before anything is created.
- **An idempotent create.** `Create` sends that token, so retrying a
  create is safe (`WithDeterministicExternalName(true)`), and `Observe`
  finds the database by it.
- **The password first.** The admin password goes into a Secret before the
  create. Every `Observe` publishes it with the endpoint, and `Update`
  resets a cloud password that differs.

| Provider | Simulated | On kind |
|---|---|---|
| faithful | conforms (60 seeds, 6 under `-short`: every fault, crashes) | conforms, with 10% of responses dropped and seven `kill -9`s of the provider |
| `GeneratedExternalName`: the cloud's ID as the external name, with a client token | conforms with no faults; **violates** `settledCorrectly` with lost responses alone, and with crashes alone | conforms, in a 6-resource run with 30% of responses dropped and in one with 14 `kill -9`s: the windows are narrow (see below) |
| `NoClientToken`: the same, without the token | **violates** `oneDatabasePerResource`: a lost response, retried as a failure, makes a second database | **violates** `oneDatabasePerResource` (30% dropped): `app1` got a second database |
| `PasswordFromCreate`: the password generated in `Create`, published only with its result | **violates** `settledCorrectly`: after a lost response, the retry's new password is ignored by the idempotent cloud, and the Secret doesn't open the database | **violates** `settledCorrectly` (30% dropped) |
| faithful, on a cloud without request expiry (`Config.NoRequestExpiry`) | conforms (300 seeds): the creation grace outlasts a late create | (over HTTP the closed connection takes the late request with it) |

| Test | Catches |
|---|---|
| `TestFaithfulConforms` | nothing: every fault and crashes |
| `TestGeneratedExternalName` | `GeneratedExternalName`: `settledCorrectly`, with lost responses alone and with crashes alone |
| `TestNoClientTokenDuplicates` | `NoClientToken`: `oneDatabasePerResource` (Hegel shrinks it: `TestHegelShrinksDuplicate`) |
| `TestPasswordFromCreate` | `PasswordFromCreate`: `settledCorrectly` |
| `TestLateCreateCoveredByCreationGrace` | nothing without request expiry: the creation grace outlasts a late create |

## Findings along the way

- **The model's ends are its id pool's.** `gotogether simulate -graph`
  explores the model's whole graph (10377 states, `TestGraphEndsWhenIdsSpent`)
  and found 128 states the step cannot leave: a resource stuck
  deleting, every one of the step's three database ids spent. No
  resource is gone within the step (only the audit records that), so
  the cloud can always create another database while an id is left;
  the real cloud's ids are unbounded, and more ids would only move the
  ends. The binding declares them (`simulate.terminal`: every id
  spent). The graph also shows `settledCorrectly` holding vacuously: the
  step never settles, so the property is judged on recorded runs, after
  their settle.

- **A late create, after the delete.** A request can arrive after its
  caller gave up (`rpc.dbaas.delay`). If the user deletes the resource
  while its create is delayed, the provider times out and finds nothing
  by the token; if it removed the finalizer then, the create would land
  and the database leak. The provider's creation grace closes it: a
  deleted resource whose create has no known result waits 30 s from the
  create's start before "not found" is believed, longer than any delay
  here (a cloud whose requests can be older, AWS's five minutes for a
  signed request, needs a grace that long). The simulated cloud also
  refuses a request past its caller's deadline (`dbaas.NewSim`, as gRPC
  does), and without that the faithful provider still conforms. A leak
  this example once reported here was the simulation's own: its stamp
  translation, converting a map crossplane-runtime held, wrote the
  create-pending stamp months in the past, and the grace was over before
  it began (`TestStampsSurviveConflictRetry`).

- **A leak with no crash.** With the cloud's ID as the external name, a
  create whose response is lost is marked failed. That's Crossplane's
  contract: an error from `Create` means failure. If the user deletes the
  resource before the retry, there is no name to look up, so the finalizer
  comes off and the database leaks. Crossplane's create-pending
  annotations only protect against crashes, and a crash is worse: the
  reconciler refuses to continue. A deterministic external name closes
  both holes.
- **The creation grace period is not optional.** I first set it to 0,
  reasoning that idempotent creates don't need it. The exploration then
  found a leak:
  1. a resource is deleted right after its database is created;
  2. the cloud's reads still lag the create, so `Observe` sees nothing;
  3. the finalizer comes off, and the database leaks.

  The grace period is what protects deletion from an eventually consistent
  cloud. The cost is that deleting a just-created resource takes the full
  30 s.
- **The grace period counts from the wrong annotation.** crossplane-runtime
  starts it at create-succeeded. A create that timed out is recorded as
  failed, though the cloud may have made the database. Deleted within the
  cloud's read lag, the resource's `Observe` saw nothing, the finalizer
  came off, and the database leaked. Seed 50 found it once qenv's
  services let a crash fall after the effect by default. `Observe`
  now waits out the grace period from create-pending while the resource
  is being deleted, whatever result was recorded.
- **What only the simulation found.** On kind, the generated-external-name
  mutant passed both runs. Its leak needs a create whose response is lost
  *and* a delete before the retry. Its stuck state needs a `kill -9` in
  the few milliseconds between the create and saving the name. A handful
  of real runs didn't produce either coincidence. Sixty seeded simulations
  did, and Hegel can shrink one. This is the case for the simulated tier:
  real runs confirm what the simulation finds, but they rarely reach
  windows this narrow.
- **A library that reads the real clock.** crossplane-runtime stamps its
  create annotations with `time.Now()` and compares them with
  `time.Since`. A simulation advances only virtual time, so the grace
  period never expired and no deletion ever finished. The kube interceptor
  now translates those annotations at the seam: they're stored in virtual
  time (`Sim.ToVirtual`) and handed back in real time (`Sim.ToReal`). The
  first version translated Update but not Patch, which double-translated
  the timestamps. The tests caught it as dates in 2025.
- **One real stamp, one virtual stamp.** The translation first converted
  each way at the moment of the call, to whole seconds. A stamp the
  reconciler wrote back unchanged moved by the virtual time of its calls
  to the cloud (7 s a reconcile, in the test), and a create's pending and
  succeeded stamps were often the same wall-clock second, converted to two
  virtual times. Succeeded could then fall before pending, which reads as
  an incomplete create, and the reconciler stopped. Each real stamp now
  maps to one virtual stamp, kept to the nanosecond (`stamps`,
  `TestStampsRoundTrip`).
- **One thread per goroutine.** The driver first recorded every
  goroutine's steps as one thread, so wall-clock order contradicted
  program order, and validation reported a cycle.
- **Running kind in a sandboxed VM** needed two fixes, now in
  `kind/setup.sh`. The host forbids lowering `oom_score_adj`, which made
  runc fail every control-plane pod with "can't get final child's PID from
  pipe"; containerd's `restrict_oom_score_adj` fixes that. kind also
  copied a localhost proxy into the node, so the cluster is created
  without the proxy variables.

## Under load: the requeue policy (`load.go`, `metastable_test.go`)

The checks above concern correctness: what each reconcile does. A
separate question is whether the provider and the cloud recover together
from an incident. In the scenario, the cloud API slows down for a
minute, the provider's calls time out, and its requeues might keep the
API saturated after the slowdown ends. This is the performance tier, on
[`qload`](../../qload) and [`qmeta`](../../qmeta). It is an abstraction:
- each Database is a user of a closed loop, observed a poll interval
  after its last reconcile, or requeued after a delay if it failed;
- the cloud API is a queued server.

The abstraction keeps what decides a retry storm: what is in flight, how
soon a failure comes back, and the rate limits. It drops the rest. The
requeue is crossplane-runtime's own limiter logic on virtual time:
per-item exponential backoff, `x/time/rate` for the global limit.

The setup is 600 Databases polled every minute. The cloud API serves 20
calls/s, and the provider times out after 2 s. The cloud slows to a
third for a minute.

| Requeue policy | Runs that recover (4 seeds) | CTMC recovery from a full queue | Hegel's smallest breaking dip (≤4x, ≤5 min) |
|---|---|---|---|
| crossplane-runtime defaults: per-item 1 s→60 s, global 10 reconciles/s | 4/4 | 9 s | none in 25 cases |
| no global limit (`--max-reconcile-rate` out of the way) | 4/4 | 10 s | |
| fixed 1 s requeue on error (`RequeueAfter: time.Second`, a hand-written controller) | 0/4 | 3·10¹⁴ s | 1.6x slower for 2m21s |
| fixed 1 s requeue, with the global limit | 4/4 | 9 s | |

With a fixed requeue, each failing object returns every 3 s (timeout
plus requeue): 200 calls/s against 20. Either half of crossplane-runtime's
defaults prevents the storm on its own. The per-item backoff's 60 s cap
is about the poll interval, so a failing object costs no more than a
healthy one. The global limit caps the provider's total. An open-loop
version of this abstraction counted a failing object's polls on top of
its retries, and found storms under the defaults that the workqueue makes
impossible. Model controllers as closed loops.

```sh
go test -run ControlPlane -v .     # the table; the trigger search is skipped under -short
```
