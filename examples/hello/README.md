# hello: the smallest simulated system

A counter service behind a network that loses requests, loses responses
and delivers some requests twice; a client that retries until it hears
back; a model that says every request counts once. The whole system is
[hello.go](hello.go) (80 lines). Start here before the bigger examples.

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| [model/hello.qnt](model/hello.qnt) | the requirement: a request is applied once, and seen again only as a replay; the client is done when every request was applied |
| [hello.binding.yaml](hello.binding.yaml) | the recorded steps as calls of the model's actions (`id` is the step's field of that name) |
| [hello.go](hello.go) | the service (`Counter.Add`, which records `apply` or `replay`), the retrying client, `Run` on a qenv simulation |
| [hello_test.go](hello_test.go) | one `qtest.System`, explored by seeds |

## What each test catches

| test | mutant | check | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TestFaithfulConforms` | none | 30 seeds, one message fault in five | every run conforms |
| `TestNoDedupeCountsRetries` | `NoDedupe`: a retried or duplicated request is counted again | the same exploration | some run's `apply` is rejected (the model has no second apply of a request); with no faults every run conforms: no retry, no bug |
| `TestExhaustive` | none, then `NoDedupe` | every run within 2 delays and 2 faults (`System.Exhaust`), then within 1 fault | all 4430 conform, the search complete; one fault is enough for a rejected `apply` |
| `TestMutationOfTheCounter` | every mutant `qweave -mutate` weaves (8), when woven (CI does) | 30 seeds each, and the client done in 90% of runs (`Takes("done")`) | `NoSurvivors`, three marked equivalent with their reasons; a client that sent too few requests is killed by `done`, an action that needs every request applied |
| `TestHegelShrinks` | `NoDedupe`, then none | Hegel makes every choice (`qhegel.Shrink`) | shrunk to one fault and a rejected `apply`; in the faithful counter Hegel finds nothing (`Expect(t, qtest.Conforms())`) |

The bug needs a fault to show: a lost response makes the client retry,
and a duplicate delivers the request twice. That is why the faults are
the environment's, chosen by the simulation, and every run is checked by
the model rather than by assertions written for the cases someone
thought of.

## Run it

```sh
go test .                       # needs quint on PATH
./run-demo.sh                   # simulate 20 seeds, check the step logs with gotogether
MUTATION=no-dedupe ./run-demo.sh
```

Next: the same System runs under sweeps (`System.Sweep`) and the fuzzer
(`System.Fuzz`); [examples/checkout](../checkout) is a saga with
crashes, isolation levels and an outbox.
